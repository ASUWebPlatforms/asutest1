  # The data_parser normally limits the fields passed on to the source plugin
  # to fields configured to be used as part of the migration. To support more
  # dynamic migrations, the JSON data parser supports including the original
  # data for the current row. Simply include the 'include_raw_data' flag set
  # to `true` to enable this. This option is disabled by default to minimize
  # memory footprint for migrations that do not need this capability.

  # Under 'fields', we list the data items to be imported. The first level keys
  # are the source field names we want to populate (the names to be used as
  # sources in the process configuration below). For each field we're importing,
  # we provide a label (optional - this is for display in migration tools) and
  # an xpath for retrieving that value. It's important to note that this xpath
  # is relative to the elements retrieved by item_selector.
