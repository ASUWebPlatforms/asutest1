    value: '<p><span>The case describes the pressures faced by the CEO and newly hired Chief Marketing Officer to transform Philips into a customer-driven organization. The new market orientation was followed by drastic redesign of internal processes to bring the company close to its customers, especially the mass market retailers. Competing against powerful brands that carried panache and enjoyed a high hipness factor, Philips must redefine its brand vision and promise. The immediate challenge is to rewire the brand message for the Generation Y market in a selected number of international markets.</span></p>'

    value: 'This marketing brief was written originally for a consortium-style executive program for Global Managers offered by Thunderbird. The original intent was to introduce the participants to more advanced nuances of branding and the creative process in advertising. Program participants create a 30-second advertisement in story-board form, and develop a presentation on its strategic rationale.'
