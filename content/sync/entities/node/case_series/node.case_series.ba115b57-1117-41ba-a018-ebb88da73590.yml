    value: "The different aspects of the organization need to be aligned with the mission of the purpose of the corporation.\r\nEach of these aspects, individually and collectively, influences decision-making and human behavior in organizations. Interactions between individuals get driven by the administrative context, and hence a conscious design of the context can help align efforts with desired outcomes. Trade-offs (all elements need not have equal depth or emphasis), while designing each of the elements of context, and the synergistic “whole” are crucial and unique to each organization.\r\nConsistency between each of these elements is what determines performance of the organization.\r\nThis case can be taught in a course on Strategic Management (module on implementation). While the focus in this case is not on a specific strategy, it can be useful as a contrast to the preceding cases that may be based on commercial organizations. For a class that does not have much work experience, the emphasis could be on obtaining a sense of the “kind of organization” that the MCGM is."
