    value: '<p>The case provides a discussion of the birth and evolution of Ryanair in Europe.&nbsp; It paints a rich picture of the avenues of competitive advantage that the company had built in its march toward dominance among the low cost carriers segment of the aviation business in Europe.&nbsp; The early segment of its history provides a very useful discussion to explore fundamental concepts in strategy such as competitive positioning, activity maps, low cost strategies, and tradeoffs.&nbsp; The latter half of the case describes the transformation of Ryanair from a pure low cost provider to more of a value added company that seeks to enhance the overall customer experience within the constraints of a low cost model.&nbsp; It closes with a set of issues that surface when Ryanair undertakes the massive shift in its strategy to become a more customer friendly airline company.&nbsp; The later half of the case is an ideal vehicle to reinforce the concept of tradeoffs in strategy and the need for strategic clarity around what a company will do and what it will not do.</p>'
