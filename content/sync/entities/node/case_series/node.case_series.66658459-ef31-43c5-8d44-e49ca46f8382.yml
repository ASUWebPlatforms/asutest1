    value: '<p>The case tells the story of Chris Freund, the co-founder of Mekong Capital, a Vietnam-based private equity firm established in 2001 when the country began its transition to a market-based economic model. Mekong initially focused its investment strategy on small and medium enterprises in the export manufacturing sector. However, over the first five years of the company’s history, the investment strategy shifted to a greater focus on rapidly expanding consumer businesses to take advantage of the broad economic prosperity arising in the Vietnamese marketplace. Where most private capital firms added value through financial engineering or operational expertise, Mekong had taken a different tack, choosing to employ what it called Vision Driven Investing (VDI). At the core of the vision driven approach was on what Mekong and its consulting partner the Vanto Group describe as “transformation.” As Freund explains “Where other PE firms choose to be really good at transactional stuff and deal making, that''s not inspiring to us. It''s fulfilling to add value to companies and see them empowered. It’s adding value through transformation.” Transformation describes a framework intended to foster high-performance leadership and organizational cultures in investee companies intended to produce breakthrough results. The case presents several examples of the transformational approach and opens opportunities to discuss its efficacy and broader applicability for organizational management and leadership.</p>'

    value: "This case is useful for exploring a unique approach to leadership transformation as a vehicle for fostering organizational performance improvements. The case company, Mekong Capital, is using an ontological / phenomenological model of leadership that has been developed by Harvard Business School professor Mike Jensen and Werner Erhard. The case illustrates how this approach to leadership development can be applied in ways that transform how managers perceive their circumstances and the opportunities that are available for them to act and relate to others.\r\n\r\nSecond, the case is useful for exploring values-based leadership approaches. Mekong, as part of its investment management approach, facilitates the creation of clear organizational purpose and organizational values in their investee companies. The case helps illustrate how values can serve as management devices to align employees around organizational goals.\r\n\r\nFinally, the case can be useful for exploring growth capital investing in an emerging market economy. The case exemplifies the investment strategy of Mekong Capital as it takes advantage of the investment opportunities that presented themselves as Vietnam moved from a command economy models to a market economy\r\n"
