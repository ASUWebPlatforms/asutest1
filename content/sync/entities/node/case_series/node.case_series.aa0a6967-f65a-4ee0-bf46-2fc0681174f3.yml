The case is written for executive education programs to illustrate financial statements to non-financial managers. The case takes a balance sheet perspective by asking students to interpret how each of the accounting events described in the case affect the beginning balance sheet. The case is centered around a fictitious entrepreneurial company established to purchase and distribute propane gas on the island of Molokai.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>'

    value: "The instructor can introduce the case by asking what factors will be important to the success of the propane distribution business. Students will generally mention marketing skills - to find new customers and retain existing customer, develop additional products and services such as risk management services and equipment financing, and distribution and logistic skills to route customers deliveries in the most efficient manner possible.\r\nAfter the introduction, the instructor can set up the worksheet on an overhead slide to enter the transactions as students respond to questions about how the transaction should be recorded. Transaction # 1 involves revenue recognition. Students can be asked to consider whether the company should recognize all $1,360 of credit sales as revenue or only the $700 collected in cash. This involves a consideration of whether the revenue has been earned and whether estimates of the uncolletible receivables can be reasonably made. If only the latter amount is recognized as revenue, students should be asked to consider what to do with the $660 difference - the balance of the receivables. Clearly, it would have to be considered unearned revenue (a current liability) and a column in the liability section would have to be created. This amount would be recognized as revenue when it was later collected in cash.\r\nThe remaining transactions can be examined in a similar manner. A more detailed interpretation of some transactions can be left for discussion until after the financial statements have been developed."
