    value: '<p><span>In early 2009, Lennar Corporation, one of the largest homebuilders in the U.S., found itself in the midst of a deep global recession, a major credit crisis, a housing price collapse, and massive mortgage defaults triggered by double-digit unemployment in the U.S. At the same time, the company faced criticism from the Fraud Discovery Institute (FDI) that a large personal loan taken out by a Lennar executive from a related party, and that the company’s extensive use of joint ventures to develop, construct, and market homes were fraudulent. FDI was co-founded by Barry Minkow, who was previously tried and convicted on 57 counts of securities fraud and sentenced to 25 years in federal prison after the collapse of ZZZZ Best Company, Inc. At November 30, 2008, Lennar had 116 unconsolidated joint ventures. Anna Amphlett, a financial analyst with Southern Cross Investments LLC, was asked to prepare a report on Lennar’s joint ventures and the methods used to account for these investments. According to FDI, the primary reason for the company’s joint ventures was to finance its investments with “off-balance sheet” debt. The release of the FDI report resulted in a 20% drop in the company’s stock price.</span></p>'

    value: "To understand how a company (Lennar) makes money, its strategy for achieving this, and the implications for its financial performance,\r\nTo analyze a company’s growth, its ability to generate cash flows, and its financial performance,\r\nTo understand why a company uses joint ventures to develop, finance, and market some of its investment projects,\r\nTo analyze a company’s methods of accounting for joint ventures, and evaluate their impact on its financial performance,\r\nTo develop a communication and disclosure strategy for dealing with critics of the company’s joint ventures.\r\nSpecifically, students are asked to consider several issues in the case. First, students are asked to explain how Lennar Corporation makes money, to evaluate its business strategy for accomplishing this objective, and to evaluate how successful execution of this strategy is likely to be, observable from the company’s performance indicators. Second, students are asked to analyze Lennar’s cash flow situation and recent financial performance, including its profitability, asset management, and leverage. Third, students are asked to evaluate the role and rationale for the company’s joint ventures. Fourth, students are asked to evaluate the company’s accounting for joint ventures and assess its impact on the company’s financial statements. Finally, students are asked to develop a communication and disclosure strategy to handle the criticism from FDI.\r\n\r\nThe case has been used successfully in MBA programs to cover corporate financial reporting issues, and in bank training programs focused on credit analysis and quality of earnings issues."
