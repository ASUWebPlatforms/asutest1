    value: '<p><span>Steve Jackson, a project professional at Western Construction (an international construction conglomerate), is attempting to introduce BSO, a new software package. Engineers at Western who would be using BSO seem to support the change, and BSO has already been adopted successfully by Western’s competitor. However, Mike Barnett, a long-term Western employee of undisclosed hierarchical status and strong personal ties to the top, is leveraging every opportunity to kill the BSO project. Knowing that he must find a way to win Barnett over, Jackson attempts a variety of approaches to overcoming resistance to change, including turning to his own boss for assistance.</span></p>'

    value: 'A major value of this case is its resonance for students. Whereas many cases about resistance to change take the perspective of the top executives as related to grand-scale organization-wide change, this case exemplifies the much more common struggle of those at the middle who face resistance in implementing their own narrower change initiatives.'
