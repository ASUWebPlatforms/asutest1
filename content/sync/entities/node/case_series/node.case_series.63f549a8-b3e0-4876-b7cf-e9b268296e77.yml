    value: '<p>The Desertec Foundation was established in 2009 to pursue a lofty vision: to power Europe by harnessing the renewable energy of the deserts of North Africa. The Foundation hoped to organize governments and organizations throughout Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa (EUMENA), to organize a structure that would use both wind and solar power to generate electricity which would then be transmitted to Europe for distribution across multiple countries and markets. It was an extremely ambitious vision based on advances in technology in energy production and cooperation across many countries. It seemed like a very good idea.</p>'
