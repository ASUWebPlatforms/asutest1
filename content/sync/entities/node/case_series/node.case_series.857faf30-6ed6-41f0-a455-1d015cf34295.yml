    value: '<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-above"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p>The DSL de Mexico case series consists of four cases (one primary case and three one-page case extensions) which focus on the ethical dilemmas managers often face in international business. DSL is a $200 million, US-based shipping company which is relatively new to Mexico. The DSL (A) case documents the history of DSL in Mexico, reviews industry conditions and provides background on the devaluation of the Mexican peso. The case focuses on Lane Cook, the 28 year old General Manager of DSL de Mexico, as he contemplates how to respond to a questionable request by a potential customer. The accompanying DSL de Mexico (B) and (C) cases present a series of follow-up ethical dilemmas for Cook to address. The (D) case can be handed out at the end of the class period as an up-date. The entire case series should fill a 90-minute class.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>'

    value: "The cases should be used towards the end of a multinational business management course when students will already have been exposed to issues related to cross cultural management and market entry strategies. DSL de Mexico (A): This case reviews the history of DSL, presents a brief overview of the industry, and introduces students to the challenges of building a business in a depressed, post-devaluation economy. The (A) case concludes with a needed decision involving a potential customer who has asked DSL s General Manager to bend some rules in return for a significant amount of new business. DSL de Mexico (B): In this case, DSL de Mexico s General Manager has learned that his company has mistakenly over-billed a customer who has in the past, he believes, cheated DSL. The GM is faced with the decision of notifying the customer or waiting for the customer to complain.\r\n\r\n"
