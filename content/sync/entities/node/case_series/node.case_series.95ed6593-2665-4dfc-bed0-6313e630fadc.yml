    value: '<p><span>An Ocean Yachts 42 Super Sport (42SS) in mint condition and loaded with the latest in sportfishing accessories has been listed for sale at a time when the market for this kind of equipment is slow. The seller inherited the boat and the sportfishing charter business from his father. However, after six months, the seller opted to close the doors and sell the boat. Ads have been placed in specialized magazines, but no concrete interest has materialized. Two days ago, however, an interested buyer came on the scene. The buyer is planning to start his own saltwater fishing business in the Florida area. There are a few similar boats on the market that may satisfy the buyer, but the 2006 Ocean 42SS is almost perfect for the buyer’s objectives.</span></p>'

    value: 'The Ocean 42SS case is designed to address the challenges of a buy/sell transaction in a time-constrained situation and simple context. The experiment is designed to be the first negotiation in a negotiation course, or a negotiation module in a sales management course. This is a face-to-face, one-on-one negotiation. The participants are given 15 minutes to familiarize themselves with the confidential information, prepare their negotiation plan, and meet with their counterpart for 15 minutes. The teaching plan focuses on the outcomes of the negotiation and is designed to stimulate reflection on the approaches taken, and evaluate how the price offers evolved and were affected by secondary issues.'
