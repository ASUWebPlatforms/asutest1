    value: 'This is an experimental case analysis in which students are expected to study the recent evolution of the Sense and Simplicity campaign through the ads and Philips’ annual shows available online. The case is designed to place the students in the role of an advertising agency’s creative director, as they are expected to produce an advertisement in a storyboard form. Further, the case will help students to understand the dimensions of the repositioning process, and explore the intricate relationship between product design and brand image.'
