    value: '<p><span>It was February 16, 2005 and Edgar James, from Merrill Lynch, one of the leading investment banks, was reviewing the file regarding the leveraged buyout (LBO) of Masonite International Corporation (Masonite). A couple of months earlier, Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts (KKR), one of the oldest and largest private equity firms, had teamed up with Masonite’s senior managers and offered to take the company private via a US$2.52 billion LBO. A shareholder meeting to vote on the transaction was scheduled in less than 48 hours, but it was very likely that the deal would be voted down. Most of the major shareholders had already announced that they would reject the transaction, arguing that the premium offered by KKR was insufficient. As the head of Merrill Lynch’s team working on the LBO, Edgar had to finalize his recommendation before talking to Masonite’s Board of Directors. Was KKR about to walk out? After all, there were increasing concerns about the profitability and growth prospects of building products companies in general and Masonite in particular, due to the ever-increasing cost of raw materials, the negative impact of the tightening of monetary policy on consumer spending and mortgage rates, and the debatable health of the housing market. But Masonite was still one of the best-positioned companies in the industry, with strong earnings and cash flows. Would this be enough to entice KKR to increase their offer?</span></p>'
