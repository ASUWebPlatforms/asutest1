    value: 'This case has been used in both graduate business and management degree and non-degree programs to provide a platform for discussions of a number of differing issues, including pharmaceutical pricing and what justifies price increases, how to create demand for a product, whether pharmaceutical firms should earnings and share price maximization objectives at a potential cost in customer access, and what role corporate compensation policy plays in business performance. It can also serve as a foundation on how to or how not to handle public criticism of corporate business policies.'
