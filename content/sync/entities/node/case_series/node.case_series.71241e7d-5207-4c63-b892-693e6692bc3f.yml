    value: '<p>The case presents the dilemma of Sita Sen, Ass. Marketing Director at the Tudor House. A disgruntled customer had placed his experience regarding a mishap in the cake order he had placed with the hotel on a Face-book food group. Now there was heated discussion happening around it and VP, hospitality, the Tudor House had also been tagged in the conversation. Post a meeting of the executive group at the Tudor House, the responsibility of handling the grievance had been given to Sita. This may set a precedence for a series of similar complaints if posted on the Face-book group, so would it be better to do nothing? or may be an apology? Cash or coupons? something in kind? To give or not to give that was the question.&nbsp;</p>'
