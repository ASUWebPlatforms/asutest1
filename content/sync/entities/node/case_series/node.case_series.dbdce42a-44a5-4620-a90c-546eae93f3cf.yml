    value: '<p>Emsad, a company in the oil and gas industry, needs to improve its safety record. The company has safety systems and safety professionals but has not established safety as a core value. Safety is based on compliance and enforcement, and production is often seen as more important than safety. The company is seeking a major new client and undergoes a safety audit as part of the client’s qualification process. The audit reveals various issues and now Emsad must decide what needs to change to improve safety performance</p>'
