    value: '<p><span>The case discusses two important themes of contemporary interest in global strategy and international business; namely, (a) the impact of location-specific advantage and the role of government policy in helping firms compete, and (b) leveraging home-grown competitive advantages in evolving into full-fledged MNEs (Multinational Enterprises). Emerging market multinationals have become a compelling force to contend with in the global economy, and this case illustrates the unique advantages that these firms bring. The case focuses on the specific issues relating to Korea and LG Electronics, one of the leading consumer electronics manufacturers in the world. It starts with a discussion of the actions that the Korean government initiated to build competitive advantages in electronics right after the Korean War, and how these specific actions resulted in the creation of a vibrant electronics industry in the country. It follows the fortunes of LG Electronics, a company that started as a contract manufacturer supplying OEM contracts to a variety of Japanese and U.S. appliance makers. It entered the U.S. market under its Goldstar label fairly early, and quickly realized that it needed to hone important skills of product differentiation, brand positioning, design, and innovation in order to succeed. Given the huge obstacle that this steep learning curve represented, LGE turned to emerging markets as a means of building credibility outside Korea. It charted a systematic strategy that encompassed a range of elements such as locally adapted designs, localized manufacturing, rural distribution, and cultural marketing that resonated very well with emerging market consumers. It had soon built a formidable position across all the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China). Turning its sights once again to the developed countries, it contemplated how it could take some of the lessons it had learned in the developing world to kickstart its developed country strategy into high gear. The case describes the challenges facing companies seeking to enter emerging markets and the important credentials that they can build in the process of understanding these settings.</span></p>'
