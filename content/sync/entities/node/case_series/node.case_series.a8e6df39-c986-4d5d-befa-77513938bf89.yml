    value: '<p>Electrolux’s valuation team was trying to finish its valuation of GE Appliances in August 2014. The GE Appliance valuation team was working out of Electrolux’s corporate headquarters in Stockholm, Sweden. Its task was to complete both a valuation and suggested final offer for GE’s appliance unit. The team’s challenge was in separating the value of GE’s appliance unit from its value to Electrolux, for the two were quite different. GE knew this, and would be building that differential into its asking price. At the same time, GE’s new industrial strategy, to move away from consumer products and financial services, left no place for appliances in its corporate future.</p>'
