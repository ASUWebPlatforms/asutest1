    value: '<p><span>Leading Across Cultures: Taiwan is part of a series of white papers focusing on dimensions of leadership in a variety of cultural settings. The authors explore the historical and cultural roots of leadership in Taiwan. Leadership in Taiwan is contrasted with leadership in other parts of the world. In addition, the authors conclude with a discussion of how leadership in Taiwan is changing in the context of globalization. This white paper is intended to generate discussion and debate. It is not intended to provide a singular/unidimensional view of leadership.</span></p>'

    value: 'The white papers in the Leading Across Cultures series can be used as standalone reading/discussion vehicles, particularly when linked with research on cross-cultural dimensions such as the GLOBE research project. Another alternative would be to use a set of the white papers to provide a compare-and-contrast type discussion. The series was created to be used in MBA and Executive Education teaching. The papers would fit well in a MBA-level leadership course or as a session in a general management course. The papers are appropriate for a class session on global leadership.'
