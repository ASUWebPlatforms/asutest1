    value: "This case is useful for companies that have extensive experience in exporting to developed and developing countries. A U.S. company finds itself facing a number of different risks: there are multiple companies involved, multiple countries that must be analyzed, and the project lasts three-and -a-half years before the exporter receives final payment for the transaction. AETC was such a company; it was an experienced exporter of a unique technology.\r\n\r\n"
