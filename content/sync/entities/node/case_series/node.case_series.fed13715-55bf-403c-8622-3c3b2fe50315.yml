    value: '<p><span>Adezan is a medium-sized Brazilian company in the packaging and logistics business. It serves a broad portfolio of customers, and counts several global companies among its key accounts. Adezan’s transformation from a manufacturer of wood packaging to a supplier of logistics services is, in part, the result of opportunistic strategies and the entrepreneurial ability of Cesar Zanchet. At a time of profound market changes, Adezan is confronted by the 7-7-7 challenge posed by Cebrace; a joint venture of global glass manufacturer Saint Gobain and Pilkington, to deliver a 7% annual reduction in packaging costs for three consecutive years. This case covers Cesar’s leadership and highlights what academic literature defines as “entrepreneurship capital.”</span></p>'
