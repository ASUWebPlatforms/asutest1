    value: '<p>Since the early days of skateboarding in Southern California, Volcom, through its founders, has been intrinsically associated with the sport. Its motto, “youth against establishment,” has stood strong through three decades. The company has been truly in touch with its customers and has learned to evolve with them—styles, tastes, activities, music, and behavior.</p><p>Skateboarding, from a marketing perspective, has transcended the U.S. borders and has become a global phenomenon with its own unique culture, rules, and values. However, as the brand lands on foreign shores, it must establish local roots and develop/adapt its personality. Possibly, influence marketing solely via American riders may need a strong face lift in view of the different roles that skateboarding may play in other cultures.</p><p>Millennials like brands that are open source and embrace participation. They are sensitive to diversity, value global community, and care about the environment. They spend almost six hours a day online and use social media daily. Besides, skateboarding (and all action sports) is increasingly connected with music and popular culture.</p><p>Volcom’s CMO faces several challenges: balance revenue growth and brand authenticity, balance the localization of marketing and sales with the standardization of functional processes, and balance the need to meet profit targets while protecting market share.</p>'

    value: "The case offers a deep insight into the construction and management of authenticity in branding, and presents a retrospective on the managerial attitude and commitment through three decades necessary to accomplish such an untouchable level of differentiation.\r\nThe case introduces students to the concept of tribal marketing, a.k.a. subcultures of consumption.\r\nAn important issue in the case is related to the globalization initiative that Kering wants to implement."
