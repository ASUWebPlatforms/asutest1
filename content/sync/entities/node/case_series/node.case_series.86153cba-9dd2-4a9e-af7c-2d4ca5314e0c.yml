    value: '<p><span>Kosmos Energy (Kosmos) was founded in 2003 by a small group of oil and gas industry veterans backed by private equity capital. The company''s original plan was to explore for oil along the West African coast. If a commercial discovery was made, Kosmos would sell the asset to an exploration and production (E&amp;P) firm. In 2007, Kosmos and its partners announced a major discovery in deepwater offshore Ghana. Three years later in December 2010, Kosmos was at a crossroads. First oil from the Ghana discovery, now called Jubilee, was delivered in November 2010. Earlier in the year, a sales agreement with ExxonMobil for Kosmos’ interests in Ghana was terminated. Kosmos now had to decide on its corporate future and its presence in Ghana. Should the company remain a pure “E” company or expand to E&amp;P, and should it retain its interest in Jubilee''s development? Integral to both questions was how the company could either raise capital for, or reap capital from, the Jubilee field.</span></p>'

    value: 'The focus can be on the corporate strategy question of “What’s next for Kosmos?” The original Kosmos strategy was exploration only, but with the Jubilee discovery and Kosmos participating in the field development, the original strategy has changed. The case can also be used for oil-and-gas and energy-focused teaching. The Kosmos strategy versus that of the large oil and gas firms provides plenty of scope for discussion. Finally, there is a (B) case focused on valuation issues that can be combined with the (A) case for a two-part strategy and finance class session.'
