    value: '<p>Reebok is facing a major competitive struggle in its advertising strategy. The traditional advertising campaigns in use have been steadily growing ineffective. Nike’s strong marketing, brand, and channel presence continue to limit Reebok’s ability to expand its market share and affects sales stability as well.</p><p>Early 2004, Reebok’s new Chief Marketing Officer planned on expanding the reach enjoyed by the Terry Tate: Office Linebacker video series which was launched during the Super Bowl. The series was a big success and spread like wildfire on the Internet. Reebok’s mission is to capitalize on its effectiveness and establish a brand personality with Generation X.</p><p>After three weeks of viral advertising, with no significant upward sales results, the issue of Internet advertising has come full circle and is now at center stage. Several senior executive see the lack of short-term sales increase as evidence of failure.</p>'
