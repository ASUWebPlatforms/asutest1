    value: '<p>Anja, the project leader for a major initiative aimed at encouraging sharing of best practices across Genizome divisions, was preparing to meet for the second time with her core project team, consisting of Mary from Marketing, Andreas from Research, Toshi from Manufacturing, and Thomas from a consulting organization.</p><p>During the first project meeting, Anja had the team members introduce themselves. After introductions, Anja spent the next hour walking the team through the project charter, and shared her thoughts about the key project deliverables. At the end of the meeting, she asked if anyone had any questions. Nobody did, so she felt confident to push ahead to risk management, detailed scope management, and assignments during the second meeting scheduled the following week.</p><p>Details about the capabilities and inclinations of team members are provided in the case. These details reveal that Anja has some work to do to get the team aligned around a common vision and set of objectives.</p>'
