    value: "The AMC in Colombia case is appropriate for undergraduate, graduate and executive education courses. It can be used effectively in both ethics and international business courses. The student must address both the effectiveness and the ethics of the decisions relating to major issues. Although not the focus of the case, the case provides information useful to the instructor who desires to cover political risk issues of international operations.\r\n\r\n"
