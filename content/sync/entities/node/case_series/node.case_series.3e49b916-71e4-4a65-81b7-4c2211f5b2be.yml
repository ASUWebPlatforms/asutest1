    value: '<p><span>Cambridge Space Systems plc, a small private company headquartered in Cambridge, England, was engaged in the design and manufacture of small rockets and space systems for commercial, military, and civil customers. In September 2005, Cambridge approached Equator Partners, a private equity firm, about a potential buyout. Since Equator funded its acquisitions with large amounts of debt, potential acquisitions needed excellent cash flow generation, and modest levels of long-term debt. Andrew Amphlett, a recently hired MBA from London Business School, had to analyze Cambridge to determine whether Equator Partners should pursue a buyout of the closely held firm.</span></p>'

    value: 'This case provides financial statement information for a small private U.K.-based designer and manufacturer of small rockets and space systems. Students are asked to evaluate the company’s recent operating and cash flow performance, and assess the company’s ability to service its outstanding debt obligations due in one year. Since the company is a private U.K.-based company, it’s not required to prepare a cash flow statement under U.K. GAAP, i.e., FRS 1. Students are asked to prepare a cash flow statement and consider how the company will handle the debt repayment issue. The case has been used in the first financial accounting course in the Thunderbird MBA program to discuss cash flows, financing, and financial ratio analysis.'
