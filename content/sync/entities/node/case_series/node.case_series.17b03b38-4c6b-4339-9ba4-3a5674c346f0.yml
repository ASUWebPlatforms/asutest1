    value: 'This case provides a platform for understanding and preventing normalization of deviance that can lead to significant deviations from safe operating practices. The examples in the case also illustrate how workgroup cultures are formed and how strong cultures can blind team members from considering warning signs and ideas for improvement from those outside the team.  Specific approaches for overcoming these challenges are shared in the teaching note.'
