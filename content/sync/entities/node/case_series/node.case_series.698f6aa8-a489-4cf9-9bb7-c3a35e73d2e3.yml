    value: '<p><span>Mitalio is a BPM (Business Process Management) developer with a solid presence in the business enterprise arena. Its installed base includes global corporations in three continents. The announcement of the merger of BEA and Fuego, two well-known BPM competitors, has placed Mitalio in a reactive position. With 140 projects with potential clients around the world in the proposal stage and with an additional 60 pilot projects under way, the BEA announcement is likely to produce fear and uncertainty among its customers. Its effects need to be neutralized as soon as possible. The loss of any of the current projects or an extended decision delay, due to the BEA announcement, may have an undesirable impact on the company financial performance in 2006 and 2007. Mitalio must address this challenge with a decisive e-marketing strategy that boosts the sales pipeline and helps position the company as thought leader in the BPM field.</span></p>'
