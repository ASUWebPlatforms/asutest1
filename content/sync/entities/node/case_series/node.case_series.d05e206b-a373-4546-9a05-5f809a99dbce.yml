    value: '<p>The case deals with the challenges faced by Anglo American mining corporation in managing local community relations where it has mining operations.&nbsp; The issues are complex and threaten the ability of the company to operate and even the viability of mining operations directly.&nbsp; The complexity is primarily due to the government policies that require mining companies to take on responsibilities for infrastructure and service delivery as a condition for obtaining a mining license.&nbsp; At the same time, the government does not actively support either local communities or the mines and is largely a passive observer.&nbsp; And, there are historical problems concerning land ownership (by individuals or by communities) as well as the challenge of resettling the people displaced by mining operations.</p>'
