    value: '<p>In 1982, seven people died after taking cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules. It was a potential disaster for the brand as well as for its parent company, Johnson &amp; Johnson. For 60 days, J&amp;J worked through the thorny issues of how to overcome this tragedy and regain consumer confidence. J&amp;J''s exemplary handling of the situation is often cited as having set the standard for crisis management.</p><p>Over time, the lessons from J&amp;J have been reduced to: "put the public interest before profits, be candid, and be quick." The actual details of J&amp;J''s activities have been lost or ignored, as have the real lessons about what it takes to recapture the consumer''s trust and loyalty. This case provides an account of the day-to-day activities that made J&amp;J''s response effective.</p>'

    value: "This case is not meant to be used in isolation, but as a point of departure for thinking about what J&J did, why it worked, and most important, how this incident differs from other crisis situations. In addition to the case, students should be assigned to read selected articles about a current crisis. In the teaching note for this case, we use as a comparison Coca-Cola's handling of crisis situations in Europe and India.\r\n\r\n"
