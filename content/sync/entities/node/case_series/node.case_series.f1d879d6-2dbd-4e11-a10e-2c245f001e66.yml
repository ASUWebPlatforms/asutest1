    value: '<p>The 1999 strategic alliance between Renault and Nissan made this partnership the longest ever among large firms in the automotive industry. Together, the alliance partners are active in every important territorial market and in every customer segment worldwide.1 As the alliance was announced, automotive industry experts were very skeptical2 because both companies were having difficulties. The initial alliance partners started from weak positions as the collaboration was formed; however, today the alliance is a leader in electric vehicles,3 ranks among the top-three largest car manufacturers worldwide,4 and sold more than 10.6 million vehicles5 in 2017. Although the alliance encountered a number of challenges and difficulties over the years (e.g., increasing industry competition, pressure to generate synergies, the financial crisis of 2008, and recent trends disrupting the automotive industry), it has been extended over time, most importantly by the inclusion of Mitsubishi in 2016, as Nissan acquired a stake in its Japanese rival. Twenty years after its formation, the Renault-Nissan alliance is a prime example for strategic alliances because of its financial success in the past.</p>'

    value: 'The case illustrates how Renault and Nissan used an alliance to overcome individual difficulties and become a major automotive group in the global automotive industry. Using the example of the RenaultNissan (later including Mitsubishi) alliance, the case displays the following universal themes of strategic alliance management and their challenges: • alliance formation and negotiation • setting alliance goals and defining founding principles • alliance governance • alliance evolution • balancing power and interests between alliance partners • partnering mode choice • international partner selection. Furthermore, the case is a useful basis for discussions on general management topics such as: • corporate restructuring • change management • international management and intercultural collaboration • partnering versus acquiring • economies of scale in the automotive industry • competitive rivalry and competitive dynamics in the automotive industry • contemporary developments in the automotive industry • electric vehicles • the future of mobility and mobility-related business models'
