    value: '<p>On April 26, 2017, Suniva Incorporated, a Chinese-owned U.S. manufacturer of solar cells and panels, filed a Section 201 trade case seeking protection—specifically, temporary relief—from foreign manufacturers of crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) cells and modules. U.S. trade law permits the president of the United States to grant some form of temporary relief against foreign imports that are found to officially injure a domestic industry. The filing ignited a firestorm of controversy in the solar industry inside and outside of the U.S. The sought-after protection was opposed by many renewable energy interest groups, including most of the U.S. solar energy industry itself. Opponents believed that a tariff on CSPV cells and modules would cost more jobs than they would save and, even with import protection, there was no future for CSPV manufacturing in the U.S.</p>'

    value: 'Students will learn: What does a government like that of the United States want to achieve with trade policy? • What would a perfect world look like in their eyes? • What impediments are there to achieving that? • How are tariffs intended to help governments achieve their goals? • Students should highlight job creation/retention as a component of tariff strategy. As the class moves through the case, it should become clear that the tariffs in this case are unlikely to create jobs and may in fact have the opposite effect.'
