    value: '<p>This Note explains some of the key issues of international trade policy.&nbsp; That entails examining the reasons that governments impose tariffs and non-tariff barriers to imports, although there are some other issues as well, such as export subsidies and financial policies that affect international trade.&nbsp; A core aspect of this policy analysis is to recognize that governments need to pursue policies that have not just economic goals, but also political and social ones as well.&nbsp; So, a trade policy that hurts domestic consumers, for example, may be very sensible for a government that needs to satisfy a particular political or social group in the country, such as a powerful union or a political party whose constituents oppose imports</p>'
