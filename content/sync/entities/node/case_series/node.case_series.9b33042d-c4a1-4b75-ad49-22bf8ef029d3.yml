The case setting is the fictitious country of Myland. The student is given background information on Nick and asks what should be done. This case has been used with international business graduate students and it always generates a substantial list of actions Nick might take. Students almost always feel that Nick should do something other than just resign.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>'

    value: "The Nick Jensen in Myland case is appropriate for use in both upper lever undergraduate and graduate courses in international business, international operations management, and business ethics. The case is a collage of real incidents and situations reported by international press organizations in the late 1990's. The case looks at the work conditions in production plants in a third world country and requires the student to consider what are human rights violations and to what degree do cultural factors play in making this determination.\r\n\r\n"
