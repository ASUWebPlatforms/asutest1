    value: '<p><span>Katka Suvarinova, a financial analyst at Southern Cross LLC, and a recent MBA graduate, has been asked to prepare an analysis of Big 5 Sporting Goods Corporation’s recent financial performance, as well as an analysis of its accounting methods. Big 5 was a West Coast chain of sports equipment and apparel outlets, with 398 stores at the end of 2010. After Deutsche Bank’s investment report maintained a hold rating and established a new target price of $13 per share for Big 5, Southern Cross decided to look at the company as a possible addition to its shorts portfolio. The shorts fund included companies that Southern Cross believed were headed for substantial stock price declines based on fundamental analysis. Southern Cross’s portfolio manager had asked Suvarinova to pay close attention to the company’s accounting methods, and particularly indicators that the company had significant off-balance sheet debt, which was not uncommon in the retailing industry. Retail companies often leased many of their stores, rather than buying the outlets with borrowed funds. From her MBA program, Suvarinova recalled that under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), some leases were not reported as debt on a company’s balance sheet.</span></p>'
