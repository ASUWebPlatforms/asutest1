Specifically, the note develops the ideas of purchasing power parity, speculative efficiency, uncovered interest parity, and the international Fisher effect, and the links among these from a managerial perspective. It includes a brief discussion of the factors driving exchange rate changes in the medium term, and of the three types of exchange rate exposure that cross-border firms face, namely translation exposure, transaction exposure, and economic exposure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>'
