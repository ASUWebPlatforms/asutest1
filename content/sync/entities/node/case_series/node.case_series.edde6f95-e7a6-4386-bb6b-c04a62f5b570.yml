    value: '<p><span>Anna Amphlett and Andrew Ferris are in the planning stages of developing and operating a store in Seattle’s Pike Place Market that would make and distribute Australian meat pies under the trademarked name, Aussie Pies. The meat pies would be made from lean beef raised using no hormones or insecticides. The retail store where the pies would be made and distributed would be visibly clean and hygienic to customers who would be able to see the production area at the back of the store through a large glass wall. Amphlett and Ferris have contributed to the business the land they purchased in Pike place Market. The entrepreneurs have approached Puget Sound Band for a loan, but the bank asked the entrepreneurs to provide the company’s business plan including project financial statements for the first year of operations.</span></p>'

    value: 'The purpose of this case is to illustrate the derivation of financial statements under accrual accounting without using ledger accounts or T accounts or using the terms debits and credits. The case is written for executive education programs to illustrate financial statements to nonfinancial managers. The case takes a balance sheet perspective by asking students to interpret how each of the accounting events described in the case affects the beginning balance sheet. The case is centered on a fictitious entrepreneurial company established in Seattle, Washington’s Pike Place Market to produce and distribute Australian meat pies.'
