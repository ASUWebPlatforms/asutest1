    value: 'The case can be used to illustrate the process of innovation and the linkages between strategy, competitive advantage, and innovation.  BlackBerry created a unique product and for a few years occupied a competitive position with no rivals.  The company’s established a competitive advantage based on product differentiation and saw BlackBerry become one of the most recognizable and valuable global brands.  Unfortunately, the initial success could not be sustained once competitors, and particularly Apple, entered the smartphone market.  After many attempts to change its strategy BlackBerry eventually was forced to exit the hardware market.  In a marketing class the case could be used to illustrate the challenges of being a pioneer versus a follower.  The case can also be used in a change management session.  The case can be used to examine how a firm creates a sense of urgency for change after many years of success and industry leadership'
