    value: "<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">Here are eight rules to think about the next time you want to send a political message to your followers:</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong>Social media is a haiku.</strong> There are things you can and cannot accomplish in 240 characters: funny — often, outrageous — always, brilliant — occasionally, thoughtful — rarely. If you have a complicated idea write an essay like they do at Google.</li>\r\n<li><strong>“La compagnie n’est pas toi”</strong> (to paraphrase Louis XIV). The company is not even close to being you (unless you happen to live in Versailles). People will conflate your views with the company’s because it’s more fun that way. The persuasiveness of the disclaimer, “retweets aren’t my opinion” falls just below ‘cigarettes aren’t good for you’.</li>\r\n<li><strong>If you blow up, don’t double down</strong>: the only thing stupider than our own posts is the awful responses. Don’t encourage them by a counter attack. Ignore, mute, or block. Not worth it.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Don’t take the ‘influencer’ label too seriously</strong>. You’re an amateur with strong opinions, not a political heavyweight. Leave politics to the pros. If you must, hire a politician. They will do two things for you: teach you the ropes and depart just ahead of the shit storm.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Try not hitting “send” for a change. </strong>It is the most dangerous button after the nuclear button on President Trump’s desk. It should be labeled ‘boom’.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Unless you’re North Korean, you are a capitalist.</strong> Don’t act like your main objective in life is saving humanity if you make money renting spare rooms. Instead, make a boatload of money and donate it.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Virtue looks better in Pradas</strong>. Unless you are a celebrity, social justice doesn’t look as badass as you think. Faces that we see on a 20' screen make anything sound good.</li>\r\n<li><strong>If none of the above work, try shutting up:</strong> No one ever complained about a post you didn’t write.</li>\r\n</ol></div>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf--leading\">Case History:&nbsp;Airbnb</h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The five stages of social media grief are rant, press send, deny, excuse, apologize. To save time, it might be best to just apologize first. Or we can stop doing dumb things on social media. You will see this play out with a viral meme going around, a post by <a href=\"http://twitter.com/Airbnb\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Twitter profile for @Airbnb\" data-href=\"http://twitter.com/Airbnb\">@Airbnb</a>’s global communications director, Kim Kingsley.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Kingsley was attending a party for colleagues on the San Francisco pier, and someone took an artful photo of the group, which she posted on Instagram. For reasons she now regrets (her Instagram account is now locked), she juxtaposed the image of revel-making pranksters with two young children in an immigrant detention center, with the caption: “…that night I fell in love with new colleagues while children 2,000 miles away were being detained in<br>&nbsp;cages.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\r\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-imageLoaded is-canvasLoaded\" data-image-id=\"1*hhB1ms6lnbgk0xGebOgqag.png\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"1488\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*hhB1ms6lnbgk0xGebOgqag.png\" data-scroll=\"native\"><img src=\"//Thunderbird-uogyk2c9lkqh.stackpathdns.com/sites/default/files/styles/panopoly_image_original/public/1_hhb1ms6lnbgk0xgebogqag.png?itok=4gCfW_sz\" alt=\"Airbnb’s Kim Kingsley's controversial instagram post\" class=\"media-element file-default\" data-delta=\"1\" data-fid=\"61487\" data-media-element=\"1\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The intent of the message was sympathetic, to be sure. But on social media, where the concept of love has been reduced to a swipe right or left, asking for deep introspection is a bit naive. The media predictably reacted to the image as insulting, craven, and very millennial.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The New York Post called it a “communication blunder of global proportion” while Fox News sniffed, a total “Air-head move.” When the Post’s writer, Oli Coleman, first saw Kingsley’s post, the only word he could think of was “cringe-worthy.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Kingsley is no wet behind the ears neophyte when it comes to media. She was COO of Politico before joining the shared rental company. If she can make a faux pas of this magnitude, so can I or you or someone we just hired to handle global communications.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One thought to keep in mind before hitting the send button is that those who agree with you aren’t going to buy the product because of the post. But those who disagree will use the company as leverage to get back at you and the company. The company’s enemies aren’t hiding, they’re waiting for the right moment to attack.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For example, Airbnb is fighting a heated political war with hotel labor unions who claim the home sharing company is stealing jobs from blue-collar workers. The unions are taking direct aim at Airbnb’s business and its wealthy founders, Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, among the richest billionaires in the world who are looking at a 50 billion dollar IPO on the horizon. The union efforts have been effective in cities like New York and most recently, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/23/world/europe/tourism-spain-airbnb-ban.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/23/world/europe/tourism-spain-airbnb-ban.html\">New York Times</a>, the resort island of Majorca.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">People may love Airbnb, but fandom can cloud perception and lead us to believe we are as virtuous as we convince ourselves. But the cynical media isn’t buying it: “Is anyone shocked that Airbnb, a $31 billion global company that’s made its fortune flouting local housing laws and exacerbating the housing crisis, would spend millions to protect its black-market housing racket?” shouted the <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-why-airbnb-is-a-threat-to-nyc-20180605-story.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-oped-why-airbnb-is-a-threat-to-nyc-20180605-story.html\">New York Daily New</a>s in an article that could have been ghost written by a labor activist. (One has to ask, how much advertising revenue does the Daily News receive from New York hotels vs. Airbnb?)</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">This underscores how even the most successful organizations are vulnerable to mass hysteria and anti-business trolling. When our modern digital enemies see viral memes from unauthorized social media posts, it is a rallying cry. Which is why business leaders need to follow common-sense rules when it comes to political opinion.</p>\r\n<h4>Author’s Bio</h4>\r\n<p>Jeff Cunningham is an advocate for enlightened global leadership, which he calls the most valuable natural resource in the world.</p>\r\n<p>He is a Professor at ASU’s Thunderbird School of Global Management and was the former publisher of Forbes Magazine, startup founder, digital content CEO, and ran an internet venture capital fund.</p>\r\n<p>He travels the globe in search of iconic leaders.
