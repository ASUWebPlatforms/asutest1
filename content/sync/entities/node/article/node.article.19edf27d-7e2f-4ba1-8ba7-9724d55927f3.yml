We have reprinted it here in order to showcase the work of our alumni.</em></p>\r\n<p>Wakanda has caught almost the whole world’s attention from the moment it premiered in cinemas, and not just of the black world. The depiction of the fictional African nation ruled and protected by the Black Panther in the latest Marvel Studios superhero blockbuster has captivated audiences worldwide through its epic storyline, a strong cast of well-rounded and grounded characters, stunning action sequences and an unapologetic celebration of black and African cultures (and of black women especially). Probably most shocking to a majority (though admittedly too politically incorrect to say), has been the presentation of a recognizably African nation as the most technologically savvy and scientifically advanced in the world.</p>\r\n<p>But the surprise of Afro-futurism coming to the forefront is unwarranted: not only because the movement to mix African cultures and science-fiction has been ongoing for decades; but more importantly because the leadership in science and technology that Wakanda exudes, though original and new for Hollywood, is actually a reality now throughout Africa. In fact, one could argue that Wakanda isn’t science-fiction per se but rather science-anticipation, by only a few decades at that.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"15922\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Africa's AngoSAT Space Station\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Africa's AngoSAT Space Station\"},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"2\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Africa's AngoSAT Space Station\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Africa's AngoSAT Space Station\"}},\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Africa's AngoSAT Space Station\",\"title\":\"Africa's AngoSAT Space Station\",\"style\":\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"2\"}}]]</p>\r\n<p><strong>The African Space Industry</strong></p>\r\n<p>Let’s start with the space industry,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://qz.com/962128/the-rush-to-develop-african-space-programs-point-to-the-continents-technological-and-scientific-ambitions/\">the least well-known African growth industry.</a>&nbsp;Though the continent still lacks a Space X, African national space agencies and space exploration have known a rebirth in recent years, after growth spurts going as far back as the early 1960s. Nigeria’s NASDRA is mapping the Niger Delta’s oil and gas reserves and tracking Boko Haram terrorists with the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://spacenews.com/nigcomsat-1r-launched-successfully-long-march/\">NigComSat-1R</a>, the continent’s first geosynchronous satellite, and four other satellites; while South Africa’s SANSA is leading the participation of several African countries in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ska.ac.za/\">international Square Kilometer Array project</a>, the world’s biggest radio telescope, to explore deep space. The NigComSat-1R was put in orbit by a Chinese launcher. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-40538471\">GhanaSat1</a>, a 1U CubeSat mapping and monitoring Ghana’s coastline, was released from the International Space Station after a Space X trip dropped it by Angola’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-launch-russia-angola/russia-re-establishes-contact-with-angolas-telecoms-satellite-idUSKBN1EN0C5\">AngoSat1</a>&nbsp;joined them in December 2017 when Russian authorities finally re-established contact with it after difficulties during its orbital launch. Ethiopia and Kenya are currently busy designing their own. Egypt, Algeria, Morocco and Libya are all operating satellites for both civilian and military purposes. This recent space industry dynamism has resulted in the African Union (AU) beginning the initial steps for an intercontinental&nbsp;<a href=\"https://au.int/en/pressreleases/20160131-4\">African space agency</a>, set to include one or several launchers.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://dastornews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cellphone_africa-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" class=\"wp-image-22938 size-medium\">Courtesy of TripSavvy</p>\r\n<p><strong>The African Cellphone Revolution</strong></p>\r\n<p>Cellphones on the other hand have become a famous example of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2017/11/daily-chart-5\">technology leapfrogging</a>&nbsp;on the continent. The strategic ramifications of this feat however are often overlooked: 1 billion African Base of the Pyramid (BOP) consumers with rising incomes are switching to smartphones and are set to become 2 billion by 2050. As the three trends of new technology acquisition, rising incomes and rising demography combine, the tail will increasingly wag the dog: the norms, trends and innovations from the BOP African consumers will increasingly become the norms and rule sets of the global market, including in developed markets.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mobile Money in Africa</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is already becoming reality: a prominent example is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/05/economist-explains-18\">M-Pesa</a>, the mobile money platform created in, by and for Africans in Kenya, which then spread to South, East and Central Asia, Eastern Europe and Latin America and was the basis for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://time.com/money/3328891/apple-pay-iphone-global-mobile-payments/\">Apple Pay and Amazon Pay</a>.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"http://dastornews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Mobile-Money2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"649\" height=\"426\" class=\"size-full wp-image-22947\">Provided by Djoudie Etoundi</p>\r\n<p>Growing beyond payments to include current accounts, savings, loans, investments and insurance, Africa emerged as the global leader in the full spectrum of mobile financial services (MFS): with half of the 282 mobile money services operating worldwide located on the continent and 100 million active mobile money accounts, used by 1 in 10 African adults; and annual revenues per active user of up to $29. While South Asia, the world’s second biggest region,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/mobile-financial-services-in-africa-winning-the-battle-for-the-customer\">accounts for 40 million active accounts</a>&nbsp;with 2.6% adult penetration.</p>\r\n<p><strong>African Cellphones and Commodities Trade</strong></p>\r\n<p>Commodities trading and pricing, especially in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/13/world/africa/mobile-phones-change-africa/index.html\">agro-commodities</a>, is another industry that was transformed by African cellphone use, as African farmers became suddenly able to compare prices quite efficiently on a national and global basis and eliminate parasitic middle men. This is being compounded even further now by the advent of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-28/blockchain-venture-wants-to-change-african-farming-forever\">blockchain trading</a>&nbsp;which is also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@igorpesin/fintech-in-rwanda-the-place-where-telcos-are-surpassing-banks-in-the-financial-sector-8a6ee8b799bc\">transforming financial flows</a>. More generally, the embrace of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bitcoinafrica.io/2017/09/04/how-blockchain-technology-can-help-africa/\">blockchain services in Africa</a>&nbsp;is set to disrupt beyond those areas to reach functions such as tax collection and record keeping in land ownership, government data or health.</p>\r\n<p>Both a consequence and evidence of Africa’s increasing centrality to the global ICT market is the explosion of tech hubs on the continent to more than 300 active ones including Nigeria’s Yabacon Valley in Lagos, iHub in Kenya, the CTIC in Senegal, Outbox Hub in Uganda or Cameroon’s two IT Excellence centers. This centrality also explains why firms like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/aug/01/facebook-free-basics-internet-africa-mark-zuckerberg\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/16/google-and-partners-commit-100-million-to-african-broadband-project-csquared/\">Google</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://telecoms.com/opinion/microsofts-africa-project-highlights-the-continents-importance-to-technology-players/\">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ktpress.rw/2017/07/alibaba-ceo-jack-ma-announces-4-big-projects-at-youth-connekt-summit/\">Alibaba</a>&nbsp;all have ongoing initiatives to grow their footprint on the continent.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Africa’s Drones</strong></p>\r\n<p>Drones for their part are a sector where many real-life versions of Shuri, T’Challa’s tech genius sister, are trailblazing.

Rice University chose Rwanda as a partner in large part because its regulations made it faster to test, patent and competitively produce drones than in the US. In Cameroon, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.journalducameroun.com/en/cameroon-startup-launches-drones-for-global-market/\">Will and Brothers</a>&nbsp;firm is locally designing and producing drones to be operated by its in-house Artificial Intelligence program, the Cyclop.
