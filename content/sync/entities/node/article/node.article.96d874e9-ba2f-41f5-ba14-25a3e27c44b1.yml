    value: "<div class=\"section-content\">\r\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing\"><em>Those tuning into the Sumner Redstone show for the first time see a nonagenarian magnate hanging onto power until his last breath. But this is just Sumner being Sumner. For those not well acquainted with him, it means someone else is going to lose.</em></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"section-content\">\r\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf--leading\">“Sumner Redstone is calling”…<em>my savvy admin whispered in a tone of hushed urgency.</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I had met Redstone in Davos which I attended on behalf of Forbes Magazine where I was the publisher. I picked up the phone and Sumner was on the line. “Jeff, can you come to my office. It’s important.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The next day I was sitting next to a lavish lunch buffet Redstone laid out for us. The shrimp were the size of lobsters. Neither of us touched the food. He got down to business.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing\">“Business Week wrote a story that claimed I lied about the fire. That I was in no danger. I am really upset and I need some advice.”</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"section-content\">\r\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\">Boy wonder</p>\r\n<blockquote>Sumner Murray Redstone is to media what PT Barnum was to the&nbsp;circus.</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">He joined his father’s theater chain, National Amusements, in 1967, and soon recognized the value of content over distribution, coining the phrase, “content is king.” Through diligence, determination, and a flair for deal making, he owns or controls Viacom and the CBS Network. He’s worth around $6 billion according to Forbes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Although he came from a prominent Jewish family, when Sumner was 17 he asked his father to change the family name from Rothstein to Redstone (a literal translation) presumably to sound more like a business tycoon. He was planning very far ahead.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">The Boston Latin School is the most prestigious public institution in the country and so, of course, Sumner graduated first in his class. He finished Harvard in three years. He decoded Japanese messages during the World War II. Then he graduated from Harvard Law School in 1947. He holds a genius IQ, and he never doubted it for a moment.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"section-content\">\r\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\">The Night of the Fire</p>\r\n<blockquote>In 1979, Redstone was staying at the Copley Plaza hotel in Boston when fire broke&nbsp;out.</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">He was unable to leave his room as flames entered the doorway and he crept onto the ledge outside his window and hung on. He had extensive burns all over his body. His surgery took 30 hours at Massachusetts General Hospital. He spent 8 years recovering and in and out of rehab. By the time it was finished he was playing competitive tennis. Sumner’s drive to conquer things isn’t just business, it’s primordial.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">From time to time, people have underestimated Redstone, at their own peril, as his board found out when they required him to take a psychological exam confirming mental fitness. They may have forgotten to think back to that night at the Copley Plaza, as he was hanging onto a ledge by one burned hand. There is something there that is going to triumph.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"section-content\">\r\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\">In Sumner’s office in Times Square</p>\r\n<blockquote>Redstone was&nbsp;crying.</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Which explains why he was so distraught Business Week (now Bloomberg Business Week) questioned the veracity of his Copley Plaza fire story. Sumner’s arm is usually covered in a business suit, but any time he shirt sleeves are rolled up it is quite clear he was burnt to the bone.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The media often looks for a hole to pin their thesis. In this case, Business Week was able to coerce a comment from the rescuing fireman that made it appear Sumner exaggerated his wounds. It is possible that deep burns may manifest themselves even days after an accident, and the fireman simply told the magazine what he saw. In any case, Business Week turned it into a referendum on his character.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The problem was Sumner never had an enemy attack him at that personal, intimate level. So he was flummoxed.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Sumner looked me in the eye and asked, “Should I sue?”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">I responded, “There are two ways to handle this. The media prefers the first, where your PR person writes the editor. The magazine will run it in the back of the next issue. No one but you reads it, and it may make you look defensive. There is another way, it’s risky, but you have nothing to lose: Go dark.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“What does that mean?”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“Going dark means dropping out of site. Talk to no one.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“What then?”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“After three months, few remember the story, not even Business Week. Then you leak something new, something no one knows. We can figure that out. Business Week will be lining up at the trough. And you take the story to their arch competitor. Then come out with a second story a few weeks later, and take that to the next arch competitor.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“What if they retaliate?”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“Who will believe them? More likely, they’ll be embarrassed by the scoops. Your power lies in allowing someone access to your thinking. So use it.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Sumner went dark. He gave his next stories to Fortune, the Wall Street Journal and Forbes. To my knowledge, Business Week — which sold itself for peanuts to Bloomberg — never got another story out of him. Even today, they are last on the list. Don’t mess with Sumner, unless you plan to outlive him.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"section-content\">\r\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\">Postscript</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Anyone involved today with Sumner Redstone’s Viacom succession should understand this clearly: if he’s living he’s winning.</p>\r\n<p>Author’s Bio<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></p>\r\n<p>Jeff Cunningham is an advocate for enlightened global leadership, which he calls the most valuable natural resource in the world.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></p>\r\n<p>He is a Professor at ASU’s Thunderbird School of Global Management and was the former publisher of Forbes Magazine, startup founder, digital content CEO, and ran an internet venture capital fund.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></p>\r\n<p>He travels the globe in search of iconic leaders.
