    value: "<p>Do you&nbsp;come across&nbsp;at&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview as a competent&nbsp;but self-interested&nbsp;candidate&nbsp;or as a high-performing team player? Many companies are anxious to hire new employees who don’t just have the right experience and expertise, but who will also fit the&nbsp;corporate&nbsp;culture and act as strong team players. How can you, as a candidate for a new job, prove that you not only have the drive and competence to do the job, but that you will also make the whole team better?  <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>I recently&nbsp;spoke&nbsp;with Rebecca Teasdale, one of the authors of the new book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theloyalistteam.com/\"><span>The Loyalist Team</span></a>,&nbsp;who has researched best practices for high-performance teamwork for the last 25 years. Here’s her advice.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3>Have your teamwork stories ready. <span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>Giving examples of your&nbsp;past&nbsp;teams’&nbsp;successes, not just your own,&nbsp;is a great way to show you&nbsp;can play on&nbsp;a team.&nbsp;When asked in an interview to share an accomplishment you are most proud, throw in a story about&nbsp;shared success.&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;<span>I’m mos</span><span>t proud of a time I helped&nbsp;</span><span>a teammate succeed</span><span>&nbsp;at</span><span>…</span><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;Further,&nbsp;if you can&nbsp;speak to&nbsp;a time you helped&nbsp;a team&nbsp;recover from a setback or deal with conflict,&nbsp;even&nbsp;better.&nbsp;<span>When our project team missed an important deadline, I made sure everyone kn</span><span>ew I had their back and focused</span><span>&nbsp;on what we could learn instead of blaming&nbsp;</span><span>others</span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3>Down with “Me” and up with “We.”<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>When giving examples of your team’s successes, use “we” language&nbsp;to show you can share the credit with teammates.&nbsp;However, when speaking of your mistakes and setbacks, stick with the “I” language to show you are quick to take accountability.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3>Ask questions about the hiring manager’s team&nbsp;– your potential peers.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>Asking questions about&nbsp;your future team is fair game.&nbsp;Show you understand team dynamics by asking questions like:&nbsp;<span>Ho</span><span>w does the team work together?&nbsp;</span><span>How does the</span><span>&nbsp;team work through conflict?
