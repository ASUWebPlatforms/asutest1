Tedx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience.&nbsp; TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. With its origin as a four-day conference in California 25 years ago, TED has grown to support world-changing ideas with multiple initiatives.</p>\r\n<p>“I had the good fortune to be exposed to the TED events before I came to Thunderbird and once I became a student here, I was committed to bringing a TED event to Thunderbird,” said Mohammed Abu Zeinab, affectionately known as “AZ” to his fellow student organizers.&nbsp; “What could be more Thunderbird than bringing together a diverse group of people to share ideas?”</p>\r\n<p>TEDxYouth@Glendale&nbsp;was an all-day event featuring 12 different speakers and a variety of international arts, culture and recreational opportunities.&nbsp; The message to youth was to drive attention inward to enhance individual reflection and empowerment, while educating that the fortification of even one individual will still increase the strength of the community as a whole.&nbsp; To view pictures of the event go to:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/tedxyouthglendale/sets/72157651722511717/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.flickr.com/photos/tedxyouthglendale/</a></p>\r\n<p>In addition to attracting corporate sponsors, the student clubs at Thunderbird School of Global Management came together to show their support with donations and provided attendees with a sneak peak of the school’s diversity and character during the event.</p>\r\n<p>Thunderbird Emerging Markets Business Association’s Bazaar showcased booths set up near the conference venue where participants explored the various cultures and industries represented at the school.</p>\r\n<p>Organizers stressed that, at its core, “World in Mind” is the realization that all the validation one might seek from the world can be found within oneself. It is the world that needs to experience that individual strength, and by fortifying yourself you are, in turn, strengthening your community at large.</p>\r\n<p>“Our goal was to reach into and open the hearts and minds of Glendale youth through inspiring talks and activities,” said Steve Luna.&nbsp; “We believe this will foster a dialogue to raise self-awareness and to realize their limitless potential.</p>\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"1108\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":false,\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false},\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\"}}]]</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
