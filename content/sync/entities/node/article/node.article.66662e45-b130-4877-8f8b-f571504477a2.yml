    value: "<p>TEM Lab, Fall 2018<br>Myanmar, Heho Potato<br>Written, directed, filmed, and edited by Tyler Stringham</p>\r\n<p>As we spend our last days on our TEM Lab in Myanmar, we begin to look back on the last 5 weeks, and we can’t believe how far we have come. When the team first arrived in Heho, Myanmar, we weren’t quite sure what to expect. The team was provided a single information sheet about our client Heho Potato and we were not provided with any kind of company orientation.\L</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"65877\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar \"},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar \"}},\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar\",\"title\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar \",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">Team Myanmar standing on Mr. Htwe’s rooftop overlooking Heho</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Our first day in Heho Myanmar was a big day. As soon as we arrived in rural Heho, we quickly dropped our bags at our hotel and set off to meet our client. We spent the entire day getting to know our client and his business and taking a full day tour of his farming operation and meeting his employees. Mr. Htwe informed our team of his current strategy, his crops, his common problems, and his dreams for his company’s future expansion. \L</p>\r\n<p>Like most TEM labs experiences, we spent the first few weeks on assignment learning, analyzing, and asking a lot of questions to find areas of improvement. We set up interviews with government agencies such as the Department of Agriculture (DOA) and the Department of Commerce (DOC), we learned from NGO’s such as Winrock International and also interviewed many company employees. After much information gathering and analysis, the team found 3 feasible and practical areas where we could make a great long term improvement on the company.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"65878\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar \"},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"2\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar \"}},\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar\",\"title\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar \",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"2\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">Business lunch with company CEO Chan Htwe, his broker/brother Chan Aye and our Winrock contact Myo Myat Thu</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>We found that they could greatly improve their efficiency and growth if they improved their marketing strategy, improved their record keeping methods, and reform their organizational structure. We built them a new corporate website at www.HehoPotato.com. We created social media accounts for the company and trained the employees on using them. We also set up a cloud based record keeping system were the CEO can see all of his pertinent company information in one convenient dashboard.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-size: 1em;\">Most of the employees had never done a single Google search on a computer, but they were fast learners. Within a short time, they learned to handle modern digital record keeping systems. The third and final change was to improve the company organizational structure. We reorganized many of the roles of the employees and made the whole process much easier and fluid.</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"65879\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar \"},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"3\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar \"}},\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar\",\"title\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar \",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"3\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">Teaching Heho Potato employees to use digital record keeping systems</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Now with all the work completed and the employees trained, our work is finally done. It is so nice to see the fruits of our labor - a pleased client, and smiles on the faces of the employees.</p>\r\n<p>We valued our time in Myanmar working with the Burmese people and we know they valued our efforts as well.</p>"
