Her long-term international assignments have included Ireland, Singapore and Argentina as well as short-term assignments in over 17 countries. Over the 2016 Thanksgiving holiday, Jonna met her Thunderbird recruiter, Suzanne Sanchez, at a hibachi restaurant in Albuquerque, New Mexico. When the two of them started talking Jonna mentioned she splits her time between Phoenix and Albuquerque for work and family commitments. They continued to talk and Thunderbird came up at the table. Turns out Jonna’s supervisor at the time was an E25 student, Denis Bacon, who was graduating that December. What a small T-bird world!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"fancy-divider\"></div>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-break\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h6>[[{\"fid\":\"8487\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Tom Mason\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Tom Mason\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Tom Mason\",\"height\":\"175\",\"width\":\"175\",\"style\":\"margin: 5px 15px; float: left;\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]Tom Mason</h6>\r\n<p>Tom has 45 years of management experience with 28 of those years spent overseas in Asia. He is prior military and, after serving overseas, he stayed in Asia, taking his first job in advertising and international trade. Ironically, Tom’s first employer in Asia was working for T-bird Merle Hinrich. Tom also worked as a country manager and then went on to run his own business. His social circle in Asia consisted of many Thunderbird alumni during the 1980s and 1990s until the Asia Financial Crisis. Tom then returned to Florida where he made a new home for himself in the hotel business. Tom first met his recruiter, Suzanne Sanchez, in early 2017 when he drove 3 hours to meet her in Miami for an event. He then made up his mind to apply and interview in June, right before his birthday. Tom is our most senior student to date “at the young age of 71”--fulfilling his 30+ year dream of being a T-bird.&nbsp;Go, Tom! It is never too late to realize a dream!</p>\r\n<div class=\"fancy-divider\"></div>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-break\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h6>[[{\"fid\":\"8488\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Tara Brooke\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Tara Brooke\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Tara Brooke\",\"height\":\"175\",\"width\":\"175\",\"style\":\"margin: 5px 15px; float: left;\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]Tara Brooke</h6>\r\n<p>Tara is an integrative medicine physician with a specialization in treating chronic illness.

Prior to medical school, Tara served in the Peace Corps in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, where she gained her fluency in Portuguese. Tara just happened to come to the Thunderbird campus the day we had “On the Spot Interviews.” It was a whirlwind and all meant to be.
