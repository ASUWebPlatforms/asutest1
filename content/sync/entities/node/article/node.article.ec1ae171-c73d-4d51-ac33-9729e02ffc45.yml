The world felt prohibitively huge.</p>\r\n<p>I surprised myself with how attached I got to the idea of participating in the Summerim program. I had heard very little about it, and I had no idea what to expect, but I knew that I had to try. So try I did, and after just a few short months of bureaucratic red tape, paperwork, and the occasional moth flying out of my wallet, I found myself on an airplane—then another—then&nbsp;<em>another</em>—and suddenly I was in my hotel room in Cape Town, a day and a half before the program began. It was early evening, and I went straight to bed. I spent the free day doing the tourist thing, posing a photocopied Flat Stanley in front of every scenic view for my cousin’s third-grade summer homework. (Flat Stanley also visited a liquor store, not that I sent that one to my cousin.) Eventually the rest of my classmates began to arrive, and not a moment too soon—any longer and I probably would have started having conversations with the paper doll.</p>\r\n<h3><a href=\"http://dastornews.com/2017/09/a-t-birds-first-flight-my-summerim-in-south-africa/\" target=\"_blank\">Read the rest of the story...</a></h3>\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"7957\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Das Tor, Thunderbird Student Newspaper\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Das Tor, Thunderbird Student Newspaper\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Das Tor, Thunderbird Student Newspaper\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Das Tor, Thunderbird Student Newspaper\"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Das Tor, Thunderbird Student Newspaper\",\"title\":\"Das Tor, Thunderbird Student Newspaper\",\"style\":\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]</p>"
