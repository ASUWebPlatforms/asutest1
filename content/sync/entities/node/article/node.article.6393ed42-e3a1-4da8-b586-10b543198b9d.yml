While many organizations strongly promote balance and healthy living, people may still find themselves challenged&nbsp;to&nbsp;find some real time to unplug and relax, or even get away, before re-engaging in their ongoing life demands.</p>\r\n<p>There are even alarming statistics&nbsp;now&nbsp;showing that work-life balance may&nbsp;no longer exist, with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.workfront.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/04/workfront-work-life-imbalance-report.pdf\">38 percent of employees</a>&nbsp;sharing that they&nbsp;still miss&nbsp;important&nbsp;life events&nbsp;(birthdays, weddings, anniversaries)&nbsp;because of bad work-life balance practices. And,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.workfront.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2015/04/workfront-work-life-imbalance-report.pdf\">60 percent of employees</a>&nbsp;blame&nbsp;bad bosses&nbsp;–&nbsp;overbearing or demanding leaders&nbsp;–&nbsp;for&nbsp;negatively impacting&nbsp;work-life balance&nbsp;and&nbsp;hindering&nbsp;their ability to unplug.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, while it’s always easy to point the finger at others and blame them for things&nbsp;spinning&nbsp;out of control, some experts believe that the only one to&nbsp;blame is the man&nbsp;or woman&nbsp;that’s starring&nbsp;back at&nbsp;you&nbsp;from&nbsp;the mirror.&nbsp;Below are a few strategies you&nbsp;should consider&nbsp;adding&nbsp;to your&nbsp;personal&nbsp;work-life balance tool kit&nbsp;so you can be empowered to&nbsp;take more control&nbsp;and&nbsp;have&nbsp;the balanced&nbsp;life&nbsp;that&nbsp;you deserve.</p>\r\n<h2><span>Take More&nbsp;Breaks</span>&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></h2>\r\n<p>You’d be surprised at how many people don’t actually take advantage of their leave time.&nbsp;Since you have vacation time and personal paid time off, why don’t you&nbsp;just&nbsp;use it?&nbsp;In fact, at least once a quarter you need to find a way to take a small break,&nbsp;a staycation,&nbsp;or&nbsp;even&nbsp;a small weekend trip to recharge. In addition, at least once a year, plan a&nbsp;longer&nbsp;trip&nbsp;or&nbsp;a great vacation.</p>\r\n<p>There are even some new tech tools in&nbsp;place&nbsp;for&nbsp;overstressed and overburdened&nbsp;women&nbsp;who struggle with&nbsp;getting away,&nbsp;like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.jozuforwomen.com/\">JOZU for Women</a>. The site&nbsp;provides customized travel packages uniquely&nbsp;designed to meet the lifestyle demands of women&nbsp;that&nbsp;offer&nbsp;features&nbsp;which&nbsp;make it safer them to travel and&nbsp;to&nbsp;book getaways quickly.</p>\r\n<p>According to&nbsp;Stephenie&nbsp;Rodriguez,&nbsp;CEO and Founder of&nbsp;JOZU for Women,&nbsp;who e-mailed with me,&nbsp;“The demand for real life experiences will soon start to&nbsp;overtake&nbsp;the need for materialism, as women continue to leverage their purchasing power to gain more&nbsp;balance by&nbsp;taking more breaks. In fact, many are now starting to realize that having enough is more satisfying that trying to have it all.&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Enough’&nbsp;is when no matter where we are on the corporate ladder, we choose to reward ourselves for work well done by taking the time to explore new destinations and enjoy the things&nbsp;that&nbsp;we absolutely love to do.”&nbsp;She shared the following recommendations:</p>\r\n<h2><span>Just Say No</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></h2>\r\n<p>Saying&nbsp;“no,”&nbsp;is a simple truth that we’ve been told for years but for some&nbsp;reason&nbsp;many of us still have not mastered&nbsp;it.&nbsp;Furthermore,&nbsp;the&nbsp;many&nbsp;things&nbsp;we&nbsp;agreed to do at work and in our personal lives can easily&nbsp;eat away at the precious time we have left in&nbsp;our day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning to&nbsp;just say “no” to things that are not critical, or&nbsp;even&nbsp;things that you simply&nbsp;just&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;want&nbsp;to do,&nbsp;is a great way to take control of your life.</p>\r\n<p>For example,&nbsp;if a demanding boss is requiring you to take on an additional project,&nbsp;take a stand by&nbsp;asking&nbsp;him/her if it’s ok for you to invite other colleagues to assist you so&nbsp;you&nbsp;can share the work-load.&nbsp;You will be surprised at how this simple task will&nbsp;significantly reduce your “to-do”&nbsp;list and allow you to squeeze in a little more “me” time.</p>\r\n<h2><span>Get Rid of The Guilt&nbsp;</span></h2>\r\n<p>Once you’ve learned how to say&nbsp;“no,”&nbsp;you must learn how to get rid of&nbsp;the&nbsp;guilt. Isn’t it funny that many of us complain about needing a break, but as soon as we&nbsp;finally&nbsp;stand up for ourselves and take control,&nbsp;as women&nbsp;we often feel a sense of guilt afterwards?&nbsp;That’s why it’s important to shake&nbsp;off the guilt and recognize that the world won’t come to an end&nbsp;just because you decided to unplug from it for a while. You’ll be grateful that you rewarded yourself with the physical and mental break you deserve.</p>\r\n<h2><span>Disconnect From Your Connected Lifestyle</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></h2>\r\n<p>It’s true,&nbsp;the technology age sold us all on the importance of staying connected and living&nbsp;a more innovative lifestyle. From&nbsp;the beepers&nbsp;and pagers of&nbsp;the&nbsp;past&nbsp;to the advanced smartphones and mobile tablets&nbsp;that we have today – no one seems to know how to disconnect. But these tech tools have&nbsp;now&nbsp;taught us, if you&nbsp;want&nbsp;balance,&nbsp;you’ll&nbsp;have to fight&nbsp;for it. So with this in mind, set parameters on when you will unplug each day, like during dinner time (especially if you are out on a date). Also, set personal goals&nbsp;like&nbsp;not checking email after 7 pm each day or not accepting work related calls after&nbsp;a specific&nbsp;time. You will find that disconnecting will actually allow you to take&nbsp;a breather and be&nbsp;better able to engage and serve others once you plug back in.</p>\r\n<p>By following these simple&nbsp;strategies, you will&nbsp;soon realize that&nbsp;work-life balance&nbsp;is not dead at all. In fact, it’s actually alive and well, but we have to&nbsp;keep it&nbsp;alive by&nbsp;setting guidelines and drawing lines that protect our personal and mental space. Ironically, by taking the time to recharge and refresh, you’ll find yourself becoming more motivated and highly productive&nbsp;because you’ll have the energy and inspiration to perform at your absolute best.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"TextRun SCXW42992605\">Join Dana&nbsp;</span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW42992605\">Manciagli’s</span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW42992605\">&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://danamanciagli.com/courses/\" class=\"Hyperlink SCXW42992605\" target=\"_blank\">Job Search Master Class®</a><span class=\"TextRun SCXW42992605\">&nbsp;now</span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW42992605\">&nbsp;and get the most comprehensive job search system available!</span><span class=\"EOP SCXW42992605\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p><em>Thunderbird School of Global Management Alumna Dana Manciagli '84 is the author of \"Cut the crap, Get a job\".
