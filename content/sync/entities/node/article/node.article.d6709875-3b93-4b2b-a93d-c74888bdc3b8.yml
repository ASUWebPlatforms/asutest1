Women in the US have made the most progress, thanks to more dedicated business resources targeted at helping women access critical capital and essential management know-how.<br><br>But gaps still remain.&nbsp;<br><br>Around the world, particularly in developing countries, financial barriers combined with discrimination, legal barriers, and policy barriers can be suffocating. Hurdles include gender segregation; the inability of married women to travel without a male escort; barriers to identification cards; and legal constraints that prevent women from signing contracts on their own, accessing bank accounts, or registering businesses.&nbsp;<br><br>For example, in countries like Afghanistan, these limitations result in a double set of barriers for women entrepreneurs, based on both their gender and their culture.&nbsp;<br><br>But thanks to <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/global-impact/project-artemis-afghanistan\">Thunderbird’s innovative hands-on mentoring programs through Project Artemis</a>, a group of women entrepreneurs in Afghanistan are getting the much-needed business know-how and personalized mentoring from Thunderbird graduates.&nbsp;<br><br>One shining example of a <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/global-impact/project-artemis-afghanistan\">Project Artemis</a> success story is Asila Sadiqi, who a decade ago began a saffron business in Herat. She credits <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/global-impact/project-artemis-afghanistan\">Project Artemis</a> with the “business advanced training and good network” that has enabled her to forge essential industry partnerships in the country and region. While she still faces cultural and safety limitations in visiting the fields, her business has flourished thanks to a dedicated and loyal staff. Her experience with the networking and mentoring through <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/global-impact/project-artemis-afghanistan\">Project Artemis</a> has led her to want to develop a “Women’s Business Association for Afghanistan Women, especially for women who do not have the economic and investment education needed for success.”<br><br>[[{\"fid\":\"67565\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Asila's Saffron Field in Herat\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Asila's Saffron Field in Herat\"},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Asila's Saffron Field in Herat\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Asila's Saffron Field in Herat\"}},\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Asila's Saffron Field in Herat\",\"title\":\"Asila's Saffron Field in Herat\",\"height\":\"515\",\"width\":\"687\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]<br><br>She hopes that by continuing to partner with <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/global-impact/project-artemis-afghanistan\">Project Artemis</a> to establish stronger business mentoring and networking for entrepreneurs in Afghanistan, more women can benefit.<br><br>You can support Project Artemis at</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/global-impact/project-artemis-afghanistan\">https://thunderbird.asu.edu/global-impact/project-artemis-afghanistan</a><br> <br> By <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/author/sanjyot-p-dunung/\">Sanjyot P.
