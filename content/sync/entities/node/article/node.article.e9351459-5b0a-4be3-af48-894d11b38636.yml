Once I did it the right way. The other time, the wrong way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I’ve also been on the other side of the table. This year, there have been eight employees who quit their jobs at our company.</p>\r\n<p>There are right and wrong ways to do it. Here’s how to quit your job, from the CEO perspective.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Do: Show Up With A Solution To Staffing</h3>\r\n<p>When I quit my first job, I handed my boss the resume of my recommended replacement. My former employer ended up hiring the candidate, and he stuck around with the company for seven years - and did a way better job than I could have ever done.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>That’s the right way to do it.</p>\r\n<p>When an employee quits their job, CEO’s immediately gravitate to solutions. They don’t think about feelings, or all the good times they’ve shared together with the employee. They only think about how to keep the business going, because that’s their job.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Showing up with staffing solution - your replacement - is more than an employer could ever want. To be clear, this is an above-and-beyond request. But, it’s a perfect way to gracefully quit because you just made a CEO’s job a lot easier.</p>\r\n<h3>Don’t: Form Expectations Based On Cultural Norms</h3>\r\n<p>When I quit my second job, I messed up. Big time. And now that I’m a CEO, the way I handled the situation is a painful regret.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The story is that I quit and left the same day. I didn’t give my boss or company any advance notice. No time to plan, counter offer, or learn what went wrong.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I did this because of company cultural norms. It was expected amongst employees that the day you quit was the day you left. No one stuck around for 2 weeks after putting in their notice. But still, giving advance notice is just the right thing to do for the people who you work with.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Don’t let company cultural norms dictate how you quit. Quit in the way that feels right, or you’ll regret it.</p>\r\n<h3>Do: Be Prepared To Leave Sooner Than You Expected</h3>\r\n<p>Even though you are putting in your notice, your employer may notify you that it’s your last day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Don’t take this abruptness personally. It’s nothing against you. Employers know that employees have formed strong relationships at the company and want to see those relationships end or transition on the right note.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But, employers sometimes want to stop the ripple effect of an employee leaving. Departing employees are like billboards that encourage the exploration of greener grasses. Employers most often don’t want that message circulating amongst current employees. So, the process of leaving is expedited.</p>\r\n<h3>Don’t: Write a Resignation Letter</h3>\r\n<p>I hate these letters. I don’t read them. The action of an employee leaving speaks louder than any words on a page.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I get that it’s necessary to communicate the reasoning behind the decision. That the decision is sometimes based on a “me not you” predicament.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>But still, say it. Please don’t write it in a formal letter. Maybe at some companies, but not ours.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Do: Present a Transition Plan</h3>\r\n<p>Again, the mindset of a CEO is focused on solutions. When employees quit, the departure can create problems (the opposite of solutions). The next best thing to showing up with the resume of your replacement is presenting a transition plan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This transition plan should be presented when you quit. You won’t get another chance to share your thoughts. After you leave the room, a CEO or boss will immediately begin to create their own solutions. You have one opportunity to share your plan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Your plan should address all of the key issues that will exist as a result of your departure. Who will manage XYZ client? How will we communicate this news to our employees? What information needs to be passed along to our team so we don’t skip a beat?&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I’ve never been presented a transition plan by a departing employee. But when I do, I’ll thank them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Don’t: Inadvertently Announce That You Are Quitting</h3>\r\n<p>If your company operates in an open seating environment, then schedule a meeting to inform your boss. Please do not ask your boss - within earshot of employees - to speak with them in the conference room right now.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Everyone knows that only means one thing: you’re quitting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When someone quits, it causes panic. That can all be avoided by scheduling a private meeting with your boss that coincides with their schedule.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If their schedule is too busy, text them. Tell them that you need to talk to them today. Usually a manager will know that they need to make time and will accommodate your request.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So there you have it. The do’s and don’ts on how to quit your job from a CEO perspective. It’s never easy to leave or put in your notice, but hopefully with these tips, you can bow out gracefully without your employer experiencing a setback in operations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><i><!--break-->[[{\"fid\":\"63021\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird alum, Brett Farmiloe\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird alum, Brett Farmiloe\"},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"2\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird alum, Brett Farmiloe\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird alum, Brett Farmiloe\"}},\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Thunderbird alum, Brett Farmiloe\",\"title\":\"Thunderbird alum, Brett Farmiloe\",\"height\":\"121\",\"width\":\"121\",\"style\":\"float: left; margin: 5px;\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"2\"}}]]Brett Farmiloe is the CEO of Markitors, a&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://markitors.com/\"><i>SEO company</i></a><i>focused on the industries like recruiting, ecommerce, and once in a lifetime experiences.
