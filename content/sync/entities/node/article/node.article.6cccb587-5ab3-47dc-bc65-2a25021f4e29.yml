After all, your hard skills —<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>degrees, training and related work experience —<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>were a close match to those listed in the job requirements.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The fact is, although the right academic pedigree is important, a majority of employers are still looking for candidates with the right mix of “soft skills.”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What are these so-called soft skills? Those are the personal qualities, abilities and habits that enable you to interact effectively with other people. They make you a good employee with leadership potential. Together, hard skills and soft skills comprise the total package that employers are looking for in job candidates.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">However, according to a recent survey from DeVry University’s Career Advisory Board, only 7 percent of hiring managers said that “nearly all”<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>or “most”<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>job seekers have the right combination of skills and traits that their companies need to fill open positions.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The study also revealed that managers hiring recent college graduates rated soft skills, such as high integrity, a strong work ethic, accountability, self-motivation and strong basic interpersonal ability, as the most critical attributes for successful candidates.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Maybe it’s time for you to assess whether your résumé<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>and interview answers represent your total package. According to the survey, here are six important soft skills that every job seeker should showcase in front of a hiring manager:</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Go beyond just speaking the language</span></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">A study from Millennial Branding showed that 98 percent of employers viewed communication skills as “important”<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>or “very important”<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>when hiring for entry-level positions. Good communication skills encompass much more than just speaking well.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">You need to be a good listener, use appropriate body language, ask the right questions and write clearly and convincingly. Obtaining a professional internship is a great way to enhance —<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>and highlight —<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>your communication and interpersonal skills.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Deeply understand true collaboration</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Teamwork and collaboration are about being able to function effectively and efficiently as a group. Remember back in school when your teachers assigned team projects? They were trying to teach you these job-critical skills.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Employers want people who can work together to accomplish a plan, since virtually every job requires some level of teamwork and collaboration, and each team member brings different capabilities to the project. Job seekers can stand out from other applicants by relating experiences that required teamwork, whether as a volunteer, during school or in previous jobs.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Employers prefer problem solvers</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In today’s fast-paced business environment, employers want to know that you can jump in to solve problems and help your company achieve its goals. This skill is seldom listed in a job posting, but always essential once you’re on the job.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Hiring managers are looking to see how well you can draw on creativity, logic and past experiences to address a challenge and solve the problem at hand. Use personal anecdotes to show the interviewer situations where you were able to take initiative and make a positive difference.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Technology skills are fundamental</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Technical skills are no longer a nice “add-on”<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>for job seekers. Most jobs today require some level of computer and technical skills.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">With technology changing quickly, employers are looking for tech-savvy applicants who understand basic software development and the latest database tools. Many job seekers neglect to mention these skills in their résumés and job interviews because they feel these skills are implied.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Work without a safety net</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Are you the type of person who can do your job without being micromanaged? Employers want workers who can proactively manage their workloads and complete tasks on time, without continual direction from others. Exhibiting your past experience handling projects with minimal supervision could give you a competitive edge over other applicants in your job search.</span></p>\r\n<h3><span style=\"color: #000000;\">To err is human</span></h3>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Everyone makes mistakes, but it’s important for employees to speak up when they’ve made one and face the consequences —<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>instead of directing blame at someone else or the external environment. Accepting feedback about what went wrong, and finding ways to correct the problem shows maturity and reliability.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Workplace accountability is important. In order to achieve larger company goals everyone must work together and be the best employee they can be. In an interview, be ready to share a time when you failed and be sure you show humility.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The good news is that, like any skill, soft skills can be learned. One way to improve is to take a writing or public speaking course at your local community college to boost your communication skills. Or, volunteer with a non-profit organization where you can develop team-building, decision-making and cooperative skills.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The better news? Boosting your soft skills gives you a leg up on a new job or a promotion, and helps you succeed once you get there!</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>Thunderbird School of Global Management Alumna Dana Manciagli '84 is the author of \"Cut the crap, Get a job\".
