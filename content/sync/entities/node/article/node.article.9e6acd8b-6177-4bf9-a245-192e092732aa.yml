Carey School of Business</a>, Santanam is known for his expertise on the impacts of technology on businesses, society and consumers. His&nbsp;research interests include mobile platforms, e-commerce, health information technology and cloud computing.</p>\r\n<p>Santanam is ready to help current and future business leaders get up to speed on these concepts in&nbsp;his one-day workshop, “<a href=\"/node/2691\" target=\"_blank\">The Future of Work and Digital Innovation</a>.\"</p>\r\n<p>In this Knowledge Network Q&amp;A, Santanam shares his insights:</p>\r\n<h3>Q: What is the impact of constant digital innovation?</h3>\r\n<p>The more I learn and see of digital innovations, the more optimistic I am about the changes to come. But those changes will bring lots of uncertainty to different pockets of society, to different workers, companies and industries. Automation and transformation are changing how we work. I can help The Future of Work and Digital Innovation participants learn to recognize opportunities and devise strategies so their organizations can achieve more with the help of these trends. <i><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></i></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>“The more I learn and see of digital innovations, the more optimistic I am about the changes to come.” <i>– <a href=\"https://ctt.ec/9f1Ej\">Click to tweet</a></i><i><a href=\"#_msocom_4\" id=\"_anchor_4\" name=\"_msoanchor_4\"></a><br></i></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Q:Your workshop covers the foundations of digital innovation and helps participants see strategic possibilities. How much of your material is theory vs. practical application?</h3>\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"7984\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"The Future Is Now: Dr. Santanam Helps Business Leaders Embrace AI \",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"The Future Is Now: Dr. Santanam Helps Business Leaders Embrace AI \"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"2\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"The Future Is Now: Dr. Santanam Helps Business Leaders Embrace AI \",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"The Future Is Now: Dr. Santanam Helps Business Leaders Embrace AI \"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"The Future Is Now: Dr. Santanam Helps Business Leaders Embrace AI \",\"title\":\"The Future Is Now: Dr. Santanam Helps Business Leaders Embrace AI \",\"height\":\"220\",\"width\":\"328\",\"style\":\"float: left; margin: 10px;\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"2\"}}]]It covers both aspects. Given so much of AI’s potential is yet to be realized, there is a lot of room for structured thought exercises. While I try to make the visioning process as entertaining as possible, I want students to understand where Artificial Intelligence (AI) is today. There can be many misperceptions. If you’ve watched <i>West World</i>, you may be tempted to overestimate AI’s capabilities to such a level that it’s outrageous. But actually, a lot of mundane AI concepts are already in use, and many concepts that are passed off as AI are really not. So I teach the foundational concepts of AI, its evolution and applications. We use a case study on self-driving cars to look at which aspects are done through AI, what data do you need, what kind of perception technology, and so on. It’s done in a way that all of us can understand. At the same time, not all of us may feel the same way about self-driving cars. That’s where I take participants on a deeper dive – let’s look at our own companies. We do hands-on activities and create structure and exercises.</p>\r\n<h3>Q: What’s your take on anxiety-inducing topics – such as machines replacing people for tasks?</h3>\r\n<p>To an extent, all of us face that anxiety. Even as a professor I face it, because digital innovations could impact my teaching. But instead of putting our heads in the sand, we need to be saying, ‘This is what’s coming, how can I do things better?’ We have to understand how these innovations redefine our jobs and industries. In the workshop, I teach how to spot those strategic possibilities and applications for your business.</p>\r\n<h3>Q: When it comes to the implications of machine learning, robotics and automation in daily life, how much consensus do you hear?</h3>\r\n<p>There’s a lot we don’t know yet. Within the AI community, for example, the debate may be whether AI itself is good for society. From a technology perspective, it may be about general purpose AI machines vs. task-specific AI machines. It also helps to think about it from a policy perspective. That debate can range from whether we should guarantee everyone a livable minimum wage when, 30 to 40 years from now, AI is so effective that it has eliminated too many jobs. Then again, what if entirely new types of jobs spring up?</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>“Instead of putting our heads in the sand, we need to be saying, ‘This is what’s coming, how can I do things better?” <i>– <a href=\"https://ctt.ec/6W40U\">Click to tweet</a></i><i><a href=\"#_msocom_5\" id=\"_anchor_5\" name=\"_msoanchor_5\"></a><br></i></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The gig economy is another aspect of digital platforms and the future of work – it portends what is to come. We’re going to be more independent in the type of work we choose and the way we value free time vs. work time. In many ways, it’s similar to society 200 years ago when the notion of year-around work was very uncommon. The whole concept of work-week and job security is very 20th century, and what’s interesting is that this concept now seems like an anomaly in human history – we might very soon be in an independent gig economy. I bring a bit of that discussion into the workshop. Why did it emerge? At the project level and at the task level? We talk about which industries have the potential to evolve and adapt, and it’s important to have that understanding. After all, today’s displaced workers expected to be doing the same things they were trained for in the early years of their career.</p>\r\n<h3>Q: What will participants take away from your workshop?</h3>\r\n<p>First, they will better understand all the enthusiasm about AI and robotics and what it means for society. They will have a better handle on its broader implications. Second, within their own business context, they will be better prepared to discern the great potential of AI and digital transformation and its influence on the short, medium and long term.</p>\r\n<p>LEARN MORE</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Read <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/knowledge-network/business-ecosystems-growing-digital-future?sd=KNarticletextlink\">Business Ecosystems Growing Into a Digital Future</a></li>\r\n<li>Get global insights delivered to your inbox – sign up for the <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/about/knowledge-network\">Knowledge Network</a>&nbsp;newsletter!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Read More!</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"/node/3017\">Is the Next Industrial Revolution upon Us?</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"/node/2900\">It's Not Just Tech: Disruption Reigns in the Oil &amp; Gas Industry, Too</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"/node/2928\">Quiz: Test Your Innovation Intellect</a></p>"
