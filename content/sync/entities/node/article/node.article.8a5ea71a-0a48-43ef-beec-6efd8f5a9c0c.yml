Polish and repair shoes, and tailor, hem,&nbsp;or repair clothing. Iron, launder,&nbsp;and dry-clean dresses, shirts,&nbsp;and suits. Stock up on missing sundries. This doesn’t require going into thousands of dollars of debt, but a polished first impression will last long after your first day.”<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>In addition, she recommends&nbsp;a hair trim, clean buffed nails,&nbsp;and clean teeth. A shower goes without saying, and skip the cologne.</p>\r\n<h3><span>4 – Come&nbsp;Prepared</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>When you were attending school, you showed up to the first day of class with the basics: pens, paper, books, etc.&nbsp;Your first day on the new job is no different.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>“Depending on company culture, bring both an electronic and traditional paper tablet in professional business cases,” Schweitzer says.&nbsp;“You may be ushered into training or&nbsp;ameeting&nbsp;immediately upon arrival. Avoid appearing hapless on day one with nothing for note taking. Do you want to send the message that there’s nothing important the company can share with you?”</p>\r\n<h3><span>5 – An Attitude of Gratitude Goes a Long Way</span></h3>\r\n<p>You were the chosen one from&nbsp;what was&nbsp;quite possibly a large pool of qualified candidates, so be grateful for the new role and opportunity.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>“Remember that as the newly-hired employee, you have a lot to learn,” Schweitzer says.&nbsp;“Ask questions, listen closely,&nbsp;and be ready to receive constructive criticism. Don’t take anything personally; instead, respond to all critiques with a gracious,&nbsp;‘Thank you.’”<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Speaking of thank you, Schweitzer also&nbsp;advises that you&nbsp;send&nbsp;a quick note of gratitude to those who helped you navigate your first day.&nbsp;It&nbsp;demonstrates that you’re glad to be part of the team.</p>\r\n<p>Join Dana Manciagli’s <a href=\"https://danamanciagl.samcart.com/referral/ihc4Zdak/mHDAKfwajfZgTWDa\"><span>Job Search Master Class</span></a> right now and immediately access the most comprehensive job search system currently available!</p>\r\n<p><em>Thunderbird School of Global Management Alumna Dana Manciagli '84 is the author of \"Cut the crap, Get a job\".
