Global Compact (UNGC) 18 years ago to align corporations on 10 universal sustainability principles and give globalization a human face.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The compact combines U.N.’s global reach with tools and best practices from business. It offers a roadmap for organizations, companies, and governments to be able to align core business capabilities with society’s pressing needs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>By incorporating the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/mission/principles\">Ten Principles of the UN Global Compact</a>&nbsp;into strategies, policies and procedures, and establishing a culture of integrity, companies are not only upholding their basic responsibilities to people and planet, but also setting the stage for long-term success. They are able to do well by doing good. And by joining the UNGC, businesses are able to launch their corporate responsibility onto a global stage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thunderbird&nbsp;School of Global Management at Arizona State University is joining the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.globalcompactusa.org/about\">Global Compact Network USA</a>&nbsp;(GCNUSA) as its&nbsp;official institutional and academic partner. The USA network is a national collection of the U.S.-based companies that are participants of the United Nations Global Compact.</p>\r\n<h3>Driving Change on Humanity’s Most Critical Challenges</h3>\r\n<p>Dr. Sanjeev Khagram, dean and director general of Thunderbird, announced the partnership at the first joint event, an annual gathering to explore corporate&nbsp;sustainability.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/UNGC\">This partnership</a> will include bringing together members of the Global Compact Network USA, faculty and the larger Thunderbird and ASU community for research, joint events, student projects and internships.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As Network USA’s knowledge partner, Thunderbird and schools within ASU will support members’ work through wide-ranging activities in order to achieve the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/\">UN Sustainable Development Goals</a>&nbsp;(SDGs). The SDGs are a call to address the global challenges we face, including those related to poverty, inequality, climate, environmental degradation, prosperity, and peace and justice.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><i>“The UN Global Compact is critical in linking the United Nations and private sector to drive change on humanity’s most critical challenges.” ~ Thunderbird Dean Sanjeev Khagram -&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://ctt.ec/OgfaM\"><i>Click to tweet&nbsp;</i></a></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>“This partnership is exciting for Thunderbird and the larger ASU family,”&nbsp;Dean Khagram said.&nbsp;“It represents everything Thunderbird has stood for since its inception over 70 years ago, which is to train global leaders who can create sustainable prosperity worldwide.”</p>\r\n<h3>Continuing Thunderbird’s Legacy&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>For years, Thunderbird has taught students and global executives about how important it is to have companies make a positive social impact in addition to a positive financial impact. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is no longer a ‘nice to have’ – it’s a competitive imperative.</p>\r\n<p>Richard&nbsp;Pearl, chairman of the board of the Global Compact&nbsp;Network&nbsp;USA, said Thunderbird’s deep expertise in corporate social responsibility and its longstanding history of partnering with the corporate sector are huge assets for the UN Global Compact.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>“We are thrilled to partner with Thunderbird. Thunderbird showed us how passionate they were about the work. Dr. Khagram’s longstanding involvement with the Global Compact also was an important factor in our decision.”</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><i>“We are thrilled to partner with Thunderbird.

Global Compact comes on the heels of increasing awareness that the private sector can and must play a critical role in advancing sustainability in general achieving the SDGs specifically. The business sector is facing pressure to take part in the fight against climate change, and companies are facing pressure to operate as model corporate citizens.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The concept of purpose and planet over profit is becoming mainstream, as the SDGs gain traction in the fight against poverty, inequality, climate, environmental degradation, peace and justice. That’s a trend Thunderbird and ASU are happy to be part of.</p>"
