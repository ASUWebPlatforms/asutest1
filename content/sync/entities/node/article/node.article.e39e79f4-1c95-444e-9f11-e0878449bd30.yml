When giving a Commencement address to military college graduates, he punctured a great&nbsp;<em>big apple</em>&nbsp;hole in the theory that battle is glorious when he told them, “War is hell.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It is why a majestic, gilded-bronze statue of Sherman by Beaux-Arts sculptor&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_Saint-Gaudens\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus_Saint-Gaudens\">Augustus Saint-Gaudens</a>&nbsp;rests in Central Park today right by President Donald Trump’s former property, the Plaza Hotel.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Two of the more interesting facts are Sherman’s horse is standing on Georgia pine needles, an artistic dig at the slaveholding South. Gaudens also purposely chose an African American model, Hettie Eugenia Anderson, for the image of the woman who leads Sherman.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"section-content\">\r\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\">The hellishness of war was something Sherman understood and knew how to make others understand. But he was trying to avoid a different kind of hell.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When Sherman burned Atlanta to the ground during the Civil War, he left behind an inventory of atrocity. It didn’t matter if you were a slaveholder or a soldier performing your duty. Victory in the most efficient manner possible was the goal of a general, and if ruthlessness helped achieve it, that’s what Sherman did. It wasn’t for glory as I pointed out earlier, nor was it for fame. He was thinking of a larger narrative.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">[[{\"fid\":\"6652\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":false,\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":false,\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]<br><span>General William Tecumseh Sherman (photo by Civil War photog Matthew&nbsp;Brady)</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"section-content\">\r\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">Lincoln and His&nbsp;General</h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The country lost faith in its Republican president, Abraham Lincoln, and his slow prosecution of the war. In 1864, Democrats ran an opponent, George B. McClellan, on a pro slavery platform. Ironically, Lincoln had fired McClellan for lacking audacity and slowness— when he was General of the Grand Army of the Potomac (the Central Park plaza is named after it). The election outcome was tilted strongly in McClellan’s favor.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Democrats were prepared to sue for peace with slavery maintaining a permanent place in our affairs. Sherman’s victory was the essential element in bringing popular opinion back to the president. He had to win and at great cost, he did.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">After the battlefield victories, Lincoln went on to win and newly named African Americans, former slaves, were emancipated officially throughout the land. Had it not been for Sherman, Lincoln would have lost. It might have permanently legitimized slavery in our young country, and over one million Civil War dead would have perished for nothing.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"section-content\">\r\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf--leading\">Sherman’s Atlanta&nbsp;Legacy</h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">It makes one wonder why there is no Sherman statue in Atlanta.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Atlanta is no longer a city in the antebellum Confederate flag South. It is a multi-racial melting pot that represents the best of what America can be when our mix of people put their heads together instead of banging them.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In a recent New York Times article on the Central Park Sherman statue, the Mayor’s office had this to say: “Feelings about the Civil War are mixed even among Atlanta’s increasingly rare natives — after all, the city has been home to one of the most thriving and affluent African-American communities in the nation. The city is the birthplace of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Ambassador Andrew Young, Congressman John Lewis, Juanita Abernathy, the Rev. C. T. Vivian.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One might think that a Sherman statue is just what Atlanta needs to address the clamor over slavery and civil rights?</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Yet Atlanta demurs. Why?</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It seems to me the city judges history with a long lens, making adjustments and changes as the local citizens feel appropriate and right for the time.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Putting up a statue of Sherman to commemorate his impact on African Americans would seem to be a good idea. For those with vengeance in mind, it would also serve as a reminder of the Southern culture that bred slavery, in a very Shermanesque fashion.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">But the good people of this most reliably mixed race city have a way of coming together to make decisions that considers sensitivities. History is never about one thing but many things.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is no different than taking down statues of Robert E. Lee from their resting place due to changes in historical views. It is time for concerned citizens to make sure the truth of history is represented in our public parks and spaces. But there are also sensitivities and we need time and a proper process to consider them.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When hooligans with masks destroy public property because they simply find it too tempting to stick a thumb in the eye of people who require more education, that’s misguided. Take the argument into the arena where we can debate and educate.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">[[{\"fid\":\"6653\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":false,\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":false,\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Sherman’s statue was finished by Saint-Gaudens in 1903, his last major work. It was said by the Saturday Evening Post after the 11-year effort, “Saint-Gaudens is one of those artists for whom it is worthwhile to wait.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">When we think of how much America still has to learn about its past, and while there is much to correct, the details need to be better understood by all, so it may be worthwhile to take some time, too.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h5><em>Author's Bio</em></h5>\r\n<p><em>Jeff&nbsp;Cunningham&nbsp;is an advocate for enlightened global leadership, which he calls the most valuable natural resource in the world.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p><em>He is a Professor at ASU’s Thunderbird School of Global Management and was the former publisher of Forbes Magazine, startup founder, digital content CEO, and ran an internet venture capital fund.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>He travels the globe in search of iconic leaders.
