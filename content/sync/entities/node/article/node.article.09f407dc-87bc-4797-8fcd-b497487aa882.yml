It seems like it was only yesterday when I moved to campus full of trepidation yet excitement. However, it has been a couple of months since I arrived campus on the 2nd&nbsp;of January this year. I am a part of the Spring 2017 cohort, and going on the fast track route to getting the MGM has been an intense experience. Having just arrived from Nigeria a few weeks before school started, I certainly had no time to think much about being homesick, compared to my undergraduate years in California. Being in the 12-month program meant getting our feet wet right from the start.</p>\r\n<p>One of the short comings of the 12-month program is that there is not much time, and many may feel we don’t really get to experience all that Thunderbird offers. However, I beg to differ. Although my time here on the Glendale campus has been a short one, it has been a very meaningful one for many reasons.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://dastornews.com/2017/11/5-reasons-why-i-am-glad-i-chose-thunderbird/\">Read more...</a></p>"
