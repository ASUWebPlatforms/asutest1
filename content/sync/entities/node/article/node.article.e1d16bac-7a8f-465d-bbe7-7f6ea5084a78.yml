    value: "<p>Our team has hit the ground here in Cambodia and we're ready to get going on this project with the Documentation Center of Cambodia (DC-Cam). &nbsp;The journey here was LONG, and we were glad to finally arrive and meet some DC-Cam team members who were at the airport to greet us. &nbsp;First impressions of Cambodia were that it is HOT and very humid here. &nbsp;We did some research on the climate here beforehand and thought we were going to miss the heat, which normally doesn’t really start getting bad until April. Well, no such luck. &nbsp;It turns out that they are currently having an unprecedented heat wave here, which made us all glad that we packed shorts and flip-flops!<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span><img src=\"/sites/default/files/p1010483.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" class=\"Image img__fid__921 img__view_mode__default\"><br></span></p>\r\n<p>Phnom Penh is a very dynamic city that used to be known in the 50's and 60's as the Pearl of Southeast Asia. &nbsp;The devastation of Cambodia at the hands of Pol Pot and the Khmer Rogue virtually destroyed it all over 30 years ago. &nbsp;Luckily for us the city is back on its feet and starting to gain back some of its old swagger. &nbsp;Situated on the banks of the Mekong, Tonle Sap, and Bassac rivers, the city is a wild mix of 2.2 million people that is exciting to experience. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So far, in our first week here, we have settled in and started to get acquainted&nbsp;with our client as well as the scope of our project.&nbsp; DC-Cam is a quickly evolving institution that is in the process of transforming itself into a larger, more multi-faceted organization called the Sleuk RIth Institute.&nbsp; This fast moving transformation is part of what our project encompasses, and has proven to test our skills already as we learn to manage the key stakeholders and concrete end goals for us to achieve while we are here.&nbsp; It looks like it’s going to be a fun ride.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Be sure to follow along with us while we are here!</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/p1010501.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" class=\"Image img__fid__922 img__view_mode__default\"></p>\r\n<p>-Wes Comstock</p>"
