She&nbsp;and her&nbsp;team&nbsp;have&nbsp;spent&nbsp;countless&nbsp;hours dissecting&nbsp;the&nbsp;employee&nbsp;life cycle, carving&nbsp;out&nbsp;touchpoints necessary&nbsp;to enhance&nbsp;the&nbsp;candidate experience,&nbsp;improve&nbsp;the relationship between employee and manager,&nbsp;and&nbsp;further&nbsp;engagement of current and departing employees.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>“There are&nbsp;key factors that play into the culture within a particular company, and when you are global, these factors&nbsp;are&nbsp;compounded&nbsp;by&nbsp;the&nbsp;influences of local cultural norms.&nbsp;We&nbsp;developed&nbsp;something larger than&nbsp;just another policy.

Hiring</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>“Hiring&nbsp;<span>smarter</span>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;major&nbsp;theme&nbsp;of our new protocol,” Smith&nbsp;said&nbsp;in our e-mail conversation.&nbsp;“Treating candidates the way you would want to be treated is a priority for&nbsp;those&nbsp;involved in the candidate experience.”<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>The&nbsp;candidate’s&nbsp;hiring&nbsp;experience now extends far beyond just a&nbsp;basic&nbsp;interview before selecting a candidate; instead, it’s a high-level initiative Smith recommends any HR team deploy.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Hiring&nbsp;managers&nbsp;complete&nbsp;an in-depth&nbsp;job requisition&nbsp;outlining mandatory skills and dependencies.&nbsp;“This forces&nbsp;hiring managers&nbsp;to think beyond the&nbsp;cookie-cutter job description&nbsp;and drill down on what is&nbsp;truly&nbsp;needed for a new employee to hit the ground running,”&nbsp;she&nbsp;said.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Next, Smith implements&nbsp;technical and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.rembrandtadvantage.com/\">behavioral&nbsp;skills assessments</a>&nbsp;early on in the&nbsp;interview process.&nbsp;Potential candidates are asked to&nbsp;complete&nbsp;one or two assessments,&nbsp;which&nbsp;provides&nbsp;insight into&nbsp;core skills and behaviors.&nbsp;Finalists are also asked to prepare a&nbsp;presentation that helps HR and hiring managers evaluate critical thinking, writing style,&nbsp;and creative approach.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>She also suggests an&nbsp;interview process&nbsp;that&nbsp;involves&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;team members across disciplines. As candidates move through the&nbsp;behavior-based&nbsp;interview process, feedback&nbsp;is collected&nbsp;that&nbsp;gives a full picture of the candidate’s interview process&nbsp;and&nbsp;creates a data library.</p>\r\n<h3><span>2. Coaching</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>In order to improve retention, coaching is vital!&nbsp;Managers are expected to be honest and transparent with&nbsp;team members.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>To help develop&nbsp;managers&nbsp;into&nbsp;“Coaching Managers,”&nbsp;Smith&nbsp;employs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://situational.com/the-cls-difference/situational-leadership-what-we-do/\">Situational Leadership</a>&nbsp;II®&nbsp;theories and&nbsp;training. While&nbsp;this model is&nbsp;new to the company,&nbsp;there are variations on the coaching concept that exist in many companies today. Look into which one is the best fit for your organizations.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>While coaching is&nbsp;the “soft” approach to employee development, the other critical piece is the&nbsp;creation&nbsp;of performance goals and expectations. Many companies use&nbsp;standard performance appraisals&nbsp;to document and manage expectations.&nbsp;But&nbsp;Smith&nbsp;said,&nbsp;“I wanted to introduce a tool that fosters positive&nbsp;and continuous&nbsp;engagement&nbsp;between manager and employee.”<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>So&nbsp;DISYS&nbsp;joined one of the latest trends in HR and&nbsp;took a bold step&nbsp;to scrap&nbsp;performance&nbsp;appraisals&nbsp;performance&nbsp;improvement&nbsp;plans.&nbsp;Instead, each&nbsp;employee gets a&nbsp;KISS!&nbsp;The&nbsp;“Key Impact Success Story”&nbsp;is&nbsp;completed&nbsp;by employees&nbsp;in tandem with&nbsp;their managers&nbsp;to outline key goals and development&nbsp;paramount to success.&nbsp;Smith said, “KISS encourages&nbsp;a collaborative and engaging approach aimed at success&nbsp;– for the employee and for the company.”&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>For peer-to-peer coaching, Smith recommends a Mentor Program. Pairing employees together to facilitate knowledge sharing creates additional avenues for learning and development and fosters company loyalty.</p>\r\n<h3><span>3. Exits or NEXT</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>In&nbsp;many&nbsp;cases, voluntary resignations are a sign the coaching manager has failed at meeting employee expectations or&nbsp;hasn’t&nbsp;acted&nbsp;to&nbsp;correct&nbsp;problems.&nbsp;To combat this, DISYS’ Protocol&nbsp;outlines the&nbsp;steps&nbsp;managers and employees must take&nbsp;when leaving&nbsp;and also includes an extensive exit interview&nbsp;to uncover lurking problems that might need&nbsp;repair.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>The new formal exit process&nbsp;is called NEXT and includes protocol on treating employees compassionately, fairly,&nbsp;and with transparency. It also includes a&nbsp;formal exit survey.&nbsp;Companies looking to learn more from their mistakes are often well&nbsp;served by an exit interview process that is rooted in empathy and objectivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>In summary, Smith is transforming her HR team to have a stronger customer-service attitude.&nbsp;“We are very proud of the steps taken to&nbsp;ensure&nbsp;we are meeting our&nbsp;business needs&nbsp;and&nbsp;our&nbsp;employee’s needs&nbsp;through&nbsp;this new&nbsp;protocol,” Smith&nbsp;said&nbsp;via e-mail.&nbsp;“The beauty is it&nbsp;remains a&nbsp;living&nbsp;experience&nbsp;and is as nimble as our workforce. As our&nbsp;talent&nbsp;needs change and the culture shifts, so&nbsp;will&nbsp;the protocol.&nbsp;All our people have a voice in how this new program evolves.”</p>\r\n<p><strong>Read More from Dana:<br></strong><span><a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/knowledge-network/how-women-can-become-fearless-public-speakers\">How Women Can Become Fearless Public Speakers</a><br></span><a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/knowledge-network/5-tips-to-turn-your-hobby-into-a-powerhouse-career\">Entrepreneur, Solopreneur – It’s Not a Hobby Any More!<br></a><a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/knowledge-network/how-get-over-being-stressed-out-your-job-so-you-can-actually-do-it\">How to Get Over Being Stressed Out by Your Job So You Can Actually Do It<br></a><a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/knowledge-network/benefits-meditation-workplace\">Benefits of Meditation in the Workplace<br></a><a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/knowledge-network/new-manager-build-and-maintain-your-credibility\">New Manager?
