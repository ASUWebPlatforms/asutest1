now&nbsp;that the majority of professional&nbsp;jobs&nbsp;today are filled not through&nbsp;published advertisements, but&nbsp;via&nbsp;personal networking.&nbsp;Not only do&nbsp;employers&nbsp;value the extra credibility&nbsp;involved&nbsp;when hiring through&nbsp;word-of-mouth&nbsp;referrals, but they also appreciate the lower&nbsp;recruitment&nbsp;cost and greater likelihood an individual&nbsp;will&nbsp;fit well with their organizational culture.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Despite this reality, however, many job&nbsp;seekers&nbsp;continue to be uncomfortable with the networking process&nbsp;and asking other people for help, favors, and introductions.&nbsp;For some, the challenge centers around how&nbsp;to ask for assistance in the&nbsp;right&nbsp;way&nbsp;or&nbsp;to&nbsp;characterize their situation without seeming desperate.&nbsp;For others,&nbsp;the&nbsp;reluctance&nbsp;to network&nbsp;comes&nbsp;down to pride&nbsp;and&nbsp;a&nbsp;feeling&nbsp;they should be able to get a job based on their credentials alone,&nbsp;without&nbsp;relying&nbsp;on relationships.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>So,&nbsp;the question arises—what&nbsp;can networking-averse job&nbsp;seekers&nbsp;do to&nbsp;get&nbsp;over this hurdle and&nbsp;gain access to&nbsp;the two-thirds of all opportunities&nbsp;that will be&nbsp;filled through personal&nbsp;referrals?<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>To answer this question, I reached out&nbsp;to Matt Youngquist at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.career-horizons.com/\">Career Horizons</a>, a Seattle-based&nbsp;career&nbsp;coaching&nbsp;and outplacement firm.&nbsp;As&nbsp;a&nbsp;self-described&nbsp;“born-again networker,” Matt&nbsp;has spent over 20 years studying the process&nbsp;of looking for work&nbsp;and helping people&nbsp;learn to build—and leverage—a&nbsp;powerful web of&nbsp;relationships around themselves in order to enhance their career success.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Matt’s suggestions for overcoming&nbsp;internal resistance to&nbsp;networking?&nbsp;“For starters,” he says, “it’s important to&nbsp;recognize that asking for help is a sign of strength in today’s world, not weakness.&nbsp;Few individuals have the resources to reach their goals completely on their own without&nbsp;assistance&nbsp;from a network of advocates.&nbsp;So if you’re still clinging to the notion that you need to be a ‘rugged individualist’&nbsp;of some sort, it’s time&nbsp;to embrace the new paradigm&nbsp;and realize that most successful people&nbsp;didn’t get their completely on their own, despite appearances&nbsp;or perceptions to the contrary.”<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Consider these three key ways to overcome networking reluctance:</p>\r\n<h4><span>1 –&nbsp;View&nbsp;Networking&nbsp;as a Research Process, Not a Selling Process.&nbsp;</span></h4>\r\n<p>While&nbsp;many people view networking in a negative light,&nbsp;perceiving&nbsp;it as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“schmoozing” or “selling”&nbsp;activity&nbsp;of some kind, Matt doesn’t believe this is the case—and&nbsp;a&nbsp;simple reframing of the&nbsp;concept&nbsp;can&nbsp;work wonders.&nbsp;“While introverts like&nbsp;me&nbsp;often feel uncomfortable&nbsp;directly&nbsp;promoting ourselves, we&nbsp;enjoy&nbsp;conducting research and&nbsp;seeking out&nbsp;answers to questions.&nbsp;So&nbsp;if you can structure your job search efforts as&nbsp;a&nbsp;research project&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;a selling activity,&nbsp;you’ll&nbsp;have more success.”&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>For&nbsp;example, you can&nbsp;reach out to&nbsp;people to learn about their industry, get advice on your resume, or ask them&nbsp;their opinion&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;various&nbsp;companies&nbsp;of interest.&nbsp;Place the focus on gathering data and soliciting advice from&nbsp;appropriate&nbsp;people, not on overtly&nbsp;“selling&nbsp;yourself”&nbsp;as a job candidate.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h4><span>2 – Recognize&nbsp;That&nbsp;Most People Enjoy&nbsp;Doing&nbsp;Favors&nbsp;for&nbsp;Others.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559738&quot;:200,&quot;335559991&quot;:360}\">&nbsp;</span></h4>\r\n<p>If you&nbsp;still&nbsp;feel you’re imposing on people by asking them&nbsp;for help with your search, you might&nbsp;actually&nbsp;have things backwards.&nbsp;“Believe it or not,” Matt says,&nbsp;“There’s an old adage in psychology called&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Franklin_effect\">The Ben Franklin&nbsp;Effect</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;suggests that the&nbsp;people&nbsp;granting people favors,&nbsp;rather than&nbsp;receiving them, are actually getting&nbsp;the better&nbsp;end&nbsp;of the deal.&nbsp;Amazingly,&nbsp;people like Ben Franklin were&nbsp;studying these&nbsp;exact same&nbsp;concepts&nbsp;over 200 years ago—and came to the conclusion that&nbsp;individuals&nbsp;reluctant to ask&nbsp;others&nbsp;for favors were, in some respects,&nbsp;selfishly&nbsp;denying&nbsp;others&nbsp;the chance to feel good about themselves.”<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h4><span>3 – When All Else Fails, Practice the Golden Rule.</span></h4>\r\n<p>Lastly,&nbsp;Matt suggests that&nbsp;if&nbsp;you feel uncomfortable networking with others as part of&nbsp;your job search,&nbsp;contemplate the&nbsp;process&nbsp;through the lens of&nbsp;the&nbsp;good-old-fashioned&nbsp;Golden Rule.&nbsp;Ask yourself&nbsp;how you’d feel if somebody asked for a similar favor&nbsp;in return.&nbsp;Would you lend&nbsp;a helping hand to a friend or&nbsp;acquaintance, if&nbsp;asked?&nbsp;If so,&nbsp;what&nbsp;types&nbsp;of requests&nbsp;would be appropriate and which might go&nbsp;too far&nbsp;and&nbsp;cross the line?&nbsp;“When&nbsp;you look at the process in reverse,” Matt says, “you’ll&nbsp;often realize how much help&nbsp;you’ve&nbsp;given&nbsp;to other people over the years—and&nbsp;gain a better appreciation for&nbsp;what works, what doesn’t, and what boundaries&nbsp;likely&nbsp;shouldn’t&nbsp;be&nbsp;crossed.”<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;335559738&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>At the end of the day,&nbsp;there’s no question that&nbsp;networking can be a tricky process to master for&nbsp;folks&nbsp;who are inherently shy or&nbsp;for those who have&nbsp;always had success landing jobs through their credentials alone.&nbsp;But as Matt and other experts advise,&nbsp;those&nbsp;professionals who conquer&nbsp;their&nbsp;lingering fears, resistance, and confusion around networking are going&nbsp;to be in the best position to&nbsp;secure&nbsp;long-term career success!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\"TextRun SCXW42992605\">Join Dana&nbsp;</span><span class=\"TextRun SCXW42992605\">Manciagli’s</span><span
