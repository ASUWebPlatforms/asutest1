Designate all the activities that you will complete during the morning hours and make sure to do them every day. Pretty soon, you will notice your morning routine is already established, and it will be hard to deviate from it.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h4><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span><span>Do you need to plan the entire day?</span></h4>\r\n<p>I believe things only happen when you make them happen.&nbsp;So,&nbsp;for me, starting out&nbsp;each day by laying out&nbsp;my&nbsp;to-do&nbsp;list, including checking&nbsp;my&nbsp;email, going through paperwork&nbsp;and&nbsp;making phone calls.&nbsp;I also create&nbsp;lists&nbsp;so I can cross things off as I go.</p>\r\n<h4><span>What about taking on new projects?&nbsp;</span></h4>\r\n<p>This is where it is so important to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.damonburton.com/making-productive-office-home/\">know yourself</a>.&nbsp;I try very hard to only accept tasks&nbsp;and projects&nbsp;that fall within&nbsp;my&nbsp;skillset, experience, and expertise.&nbsp;Focusing on things within your field of interest will squeeze your creative juices and provide&nbsp;fulfillment but&nbsp;doing things that&nbsp;don’t match your abilities can&nbsp;be frustrating and&nbsp;cause you to stagnate.</p>\r\n<h4><span>You’ve also talked about the importance of taking a break.</span></h4>\r\n<p>Everybody needs time to&nbsp;refresh but&nbsp;taking time off doesn’t&nbsp;mean that you need to be idle. You can take a break from your normal work and&nbsp;still be&nbsp;productive&nbsp;by reading, listening to your favorite music, or doing volunteer work.</p>\r\n<h4><span>What else do you recommend&nbsp;to be&nbsp;more productive?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></h4>\r\n<p>The end of the day&nbsp;should&nbsp;also follow a routine, such as bonding with your family. Wrap up emails, finish&nbsp;phone calls, and clean up your desk. Then leave work at work and focus on relationships, personal time, and getting adequate rest for the next day.</p>\r\n<p>Damon is right!&nbsp;&nbsp;As you establish healthy habits and routines, you’re setting yourself up to be more and more efficient on the job and more content in other areas of your life.</p>\r\n<p><em><span>Thunderbird School of Global Management Alumna Dana Manciagli '84 is the author of \"Cut the crap, Get a job\".
