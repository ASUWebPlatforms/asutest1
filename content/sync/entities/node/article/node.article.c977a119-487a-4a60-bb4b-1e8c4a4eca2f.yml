Nationalism is often linked to negative things like bigotry, protectionism, and xenophobia. But it also carries positive connotations, such as patriotism and good citizenship, and it is on the rise. This has led some executives to ask themselves personally defining questions: “Am I a globalist or a nationalist? Can I be both?” The answer to the second question is yes, with a deliberately integrative approach. Before making any major decision that seems to juxtapose a globalist view against a nationalist view, take the following steps. First, recognize and explain to your team that it is not only okay, but actually important, to take both perspectives into account even if we naturally lean toward one side or the other. Second, ask three questions: 1) What criteria would a pure nationalist decision-maker who focuses on clear benefits to national stakeholders use?; 2) What criteria would a pure globalist decision-maker who focuses on benefits to the global corporation and the broader world use?; and 3) How can we integrate at least some of the two sets of criteria in making the final decision?"

    summary: "Congratulations to two Thunderbird professors who were recently published in Harvard Businss Review.\r\n\r\nProfessor Allen Morrison has published What Will Happen to Your Business in Hong Kong? Recent developments in Hong Kong pose significant threats to foreign firms operating there – of which 1,300 or so are US firms.  What exactly happens to them will depend to a large extent on why they are in Hong Kong (is it just for the Hong Kong market, for China’s markets, or for Asia as a whole?).  But in any event, all companies should take care to secure their people, consider potential scenarios, and create options in the event a major move is required."
