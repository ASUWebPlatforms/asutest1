    value: "<p>On September 19, Thunderbird alumnus Mohit Chuganees '88 and his wife Bhakti welcomed four graduates of <a href=\"/node/1143\">Thunderbird for Good’s Project Artemis</a> to their home in Mumbai, India, along with approximately 50 fellow T-birds, spouses, and friends of Thunderbird.&nbsp;An impressive gathering for just a few days’ notice!&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The Artemis alumni were in Mumbai as part of a certificate program on “Generative Leadership and Social Entrepreneurship” hosted by <a href=\"http://www.tiss.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Tata Institute of Social Sciences</a> and sponsored in partnership with the American University of Afghanistan (<a href=\"https://www.auaf.edu.af/centers-of-excellence/icawed/\">AUAF</a>). These businesswomen were specially chosen to participate in this program on scholarship by The Women’s Center at the AUAF based on past business success and potential for growth. It is remarkable that four of the 13 chosen participants are alumni of the Artemis program, and a testament to the business growth these women are able to leverage with education.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thunderbird Class of ’88 alumnus and Project Artemis champion Vijay Anand Jangiti introduced Thunderbird for Good and spoke about Project Artemis, introducing Homa, Artemis class of ’16. Homa spoke to the assembled alumni about how Project Artemis had helped them to understand the nuances of doing business and get clarity around their strategic visions, telling those present that it was the “best training” for businesswomen, and thanking Thunderbird for continuing to run the program through many challenges in Afghanistan. She then introduced the other three Artemis alumni, Noorjahan ’16, Romina ’10, and Nasimgul ’10, expressing their gratefulness for such a warm welcome on the part of the T-birds. The Artemis ladies spent the evening circulating and talking with many in attendance until they had to depart to get ready for an early flight.</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"65889\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird and Project Artemis Alumni Gather in Mumbai, India\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird and Project Artemis Alumni Gather in Mumbai, India\"},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"2\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird and Project Artemis Alumni Gather in Mumbai, India\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird and Project Artemis Alumni Gather in Mumbai, India\"}},\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Thunderbird and Project Artemis Alumni Gather in Mumbai, India\",\"title\":\"Thunderbird and Project Artemis Alumni Gather in Mumbai, India\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"2\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">Project Artemis alumni from 2010 and 2016 welcomed by Thunderbird alumni, spouses, and friends of the school in Mumbai on September 19.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><br><br></p>\r\n<p>In true Thunderbird fashion, the Artemis alumni report that they were made to feel “incredibly welcome” by the alumni group in Mumbai. Additionally, the women report that at least one business connection was made that may result in a new export market, several good conversations about marketing and growth strategy were had, and many more friendships were begun. Sounds like Thunderbird networking at its best!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This is just one small example of how Thunderbird alumni support Project Artemis. T-birds not only plan and attend events during the program, but they also volunteer as mentors, helpers and visiting instructors, host business visits, and continue to support and befriend Artemis alumni long after they have graduated – as this event perfectly illustrates! Thunderbird alumni are also the lifeblood of fundraising for Project Artemis, donating significant funding for the program’s first six cohorts, and leading the fundraising effort underway now for the next Project Artemis. So what are you waiting for? Click this <a href=\"https://pitchfunder.asufoundation.org/project/11218\">LINK</a> and help us bring the next group of driven Afghan women entrepreneurs to participate in this life-changing program.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Project Artemis is a transformative initiative delivered by <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/\">Thunderbird School of Global Management</a> that offers Afghan women entrepreneurs intensive business training and mentoring. Artemis graduates have returned to Afghanistan to run successful businesses that have created over 3,000 jobs for their local communities, and have trained and mentored well over 15,000 of their fellow Afghan citizens in business and leadership skills. <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/global-impact/project-artemis-afghanistan\">Learn more about Project Artemis</a>&nbsp;and how you can support mentoring programs for Afghan women entrepreneurs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thunderbird for Good: <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/global-impact/thunderbird-for-good-programs\">https://thunderbird.asu.edu/global-impact/thunderbird-for-good-programs</a></p>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Project Artemis: <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/global-impact/project-artemis-afghanistan\">https://thunderbird.asu.edu/global-impact/project-artemis-afghanistan</a></p>\r\n<p>Artemis Donations: <a href=\"https://pitchfunder.asufoundation.org/project/11218\">https://pitchfunder.asufoundation.org/project/11218</a>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>American University of Afghanistan: <a href=\"https://www.auaf.edu.af/centers-of-excellence/icawed/\">https://www.auaf.edu.af/centers-of-excellence/icawed/</a></p>\r\n</div>"
