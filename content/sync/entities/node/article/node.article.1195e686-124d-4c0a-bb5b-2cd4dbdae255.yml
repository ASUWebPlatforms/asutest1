    value: "<p>Being terminated from a job is scary. Reality&nbsp;is, it’s not always your fault, but in some cases, there may have been steps you could have taken to prevent it from happening.</p>\r\n<p>There are&nbsp;usually&nbsp;three reasons&nbsp;why you could get fired, says Debra Benton, co-author with Kylie Wright-Ford of&nbsp;the new book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.makethemindswitch.com/\"><span>The Leadership Mind Switch</span></a>. Debra shared with me&nbsp;the ways&nbsp;you can do something about&nbsp;two out of&nbsp;those&nbsp;three reasons.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>These are&nbsp;three reasons&nbsp;you could be fired and what you can do about it:</p>\r\n<h3>You lie, steal, or cheat.</h3>\r\n<p>Clearly&nbsp;this one is totally under your control. The simple resolution – don’t do it!</p>\r\n<h3>The company is doing poorly.</h3>\r\n<p>Weak sales or bad management could&nbsp;cause the necessary cutbacks.&nbsp;You likely have little control over either, unless you are the head of sales or the lousy boss&nbsp;in question.</p>\r\n<h3>You require more managing than your boss is able to give you.</h3>\r\n<p>This one is your own doing and you can do something about it.&nbsp;If you create more problems than your boss can handle, or if you make her job more difficult because you require&nbsp;excessive&nbsp;handholding or coddling, you are likely to get fired.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335559685&quot;:360}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Let’s look at&nbsp;this&nbsp;from your boss’s perspective.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335559685&quot;:720}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>You are hired for one reason: <strong>to solve problems</strong>.&nbsp;Your&nbsp;<span>function</span>&nbsp;might be as an accountant, machine operator,&nbsp;or a technical advisor; your&nbsp;<span>job</span>&nbsp;is to get done what needs to get done.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>A good boss makes your job objective&nbsp;clear, provides tools to meet the objective,&nbsp;and&nbsp;is there to answer questions and guide you as needed.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>When you don’t listen to your boss, use&nbsp;the&nbsp;tools&nbsp;that are&nbsp;available to you, understand the objective, meet the objective, or abdicate your responsibility for understanding the boss’s needs, she can choose to give you&nbsp;the additional&nbsp;time and attention that others don’t&nbsp;need,&nbsp;or not. Occasionally that is expected&nbsp;and accepted.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>But if you continue to require too much of her time and attention&nbsp;to&nbsp;get your job done, she is going to&nbsp;make the decision&nbsp;to find someone who doesn’t. It’s that simple.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>So&nbsp;what can you do to make sure you don’t require more managing than your boss is able&nbsp;or&nbsp;willing&nbsp;to&nbsp;provide? Understand&nbsp;that&nbsp;your boss&nbsp;has&nbsp;bigger responsibilities&nbsp;over and above just&nbsp;managing&nbsp;you.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Find out her own job objective&nbsp;and&nbsp;where you can help her. Do the best job you are capable of and check in to see if it met her objectives. Don’t whine, complain, be late on deadlines, spread gossip,&nbsp;or&nbsp;get involved in&nbsp;any activity that causes your boss to stop doing what she needs to&nbsp;do&nbsp;in order&nbsp;to deal with&nbsp;you.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Yes, there are usually three reasons why you&nbsp;could get fired, and you control two of them. Two out of three isn’t bad!<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Join Dana Manciagli’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://danamanciagl.samcart.com/referral/ihc4Zdak/mHDAKfwajfZgTWDa\">Job Search Master Class</a>&nbsp;<em>right now</em>&nbsp;and immediately access the most comprehensive job search system currently available!</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:sindhus@microsoft.com\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n<p><em>Thunderbird School of Global Management Alumna Dana Manciagli '84 is the author of \"Cut the crap, Get a job\".
