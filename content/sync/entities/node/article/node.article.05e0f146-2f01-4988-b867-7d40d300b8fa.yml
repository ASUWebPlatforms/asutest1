    value: "<p><i>This profile is part of a series highlighting the personal stories and achievements of Thunderbird students. Ready to read more? Subscribe to the Knowledge Network newsletter at </i><a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/knowledge-network\"><i>https://thunderbird.asu.edu/knowledge-network</i></a><i> </i></p>\r\n<p>During her Air Force days, you’d more likely find Ashley Knobloch in a laboratory than a cockpit. As a Senior Airman E-4, Ashley’s job was to test blood and bodily fluids.</p>\r\n<p>“It was interesting work, using chemistry and microbiology, and I gained an appreciation for following procedures and a scientific approach,” she says. “It also got me interested in studying human factors, because as a tech you’re interfacing with fairly complex machines.”</p>\r\n<p>Human factors is the study of human performance across diverse systems, tasks, technology, and environments. The focus of Ashley’s <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/degrees/graduate/master-global-management\">Master of Global Management (MGM)</a> at Thunderbird is bringing the human factors perspective to business. “This can apply to product design, marketing, any discipline,” she explains. “It’s the understanding of the human interaction of a product or experience. I want this perspective to be infused in my career in business. I'm really looking to blend the two.”</p>\r\n<p>Ashley’s work in the Air Force sharpened her eye for this field. “You’re relying on instructional material, and sometimes it’s of poor quality. Also, some functions of the machines are not user friendly,” she says. “There’s so much to be done in terms of improvements and preventing errors.”</p>\r\n<h3>After the Air Force: Arizona</h3>\r\n<p>Ashley grew up in Michigan, but in the Air Force she was stationed in Texas, Arizona, and Nevada. After her military service, she headed back to Arizona. “My dad lives here – that’s probably the only reason I considered it,” she says. “I didn’t even realize all the interesting things going on here in Phoenix. It has a lot to offer. Now I just love it here.”</p>\r\n<p>Ashley enrolled at Arizona State University and finished her undergraduate studies in applied psychology, a degree she had chipped away at with coursework before and during her Air Force service. She then pursued a master’s degree at ASU Polytechnic, which has “one of the best programs in the country for interdisciplinary studies in psychology and engineering,” she says.</p>\r\n<p>From there, the dots continued to connect: Ashley received a letter from ASU describing Thunderbird and its programs. “I looked through the website and then made a call – I spent at least 45 minutes on the phone with a recruiter. I was impressed, because it seemed unusual for a university to give you that much of their time.”</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><i>“The people are what make Thunderbird so different.” </i><i>– <a href=\"https://ctt.ec/cnI7_\">Click to tweet</a></i><i><a href=\"#_msocom_1\"></a><br></i></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Ashley had considered pursuing an MBA but expected to delay it for a few years. “I looked at other schools, but nothing really drew me in,” she says. “But when I looked at Thunderbird, I could see it was different. Other business schools teach business, but this was more of a holistic approach that considered the human aspects across cultures. And it’s rare these days to have a career that doesn’t touch the global aspect.”</p>\r\n<p>When the recruiter told her about scholarships, Ashley was sold. She then reached out to her brother, who had recently graduated from college after serving four years in the Marine Corps. “He called the recruiter, too, and he thought she was amazing. So we both decided to come to Thunderbird, and now we’re here in the same cohort.” She adds with a laugh: “Yes, we’re twins.”</p>\r\n<p>Ashley, who is now a <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/ca\">Campus Ambassador</a>, notes that graduate students can often stress and struggle during the application process and on-boarding. “But Thunderbird made it really seamless,” she says. “My recruiter helped me pull my application package together. She would call me back. It felt more personal. So Thunderbird was very much a part of the process. Sure, there was the library and other resources, but the people are what make this place so different.”</p>\r\n<h3>Teachers are ‘true practitioners’</h3>\r\n<p>Now that she’s studying at Thunderbird, Ashley is more immersed than ever in the human aspect of business. “You could have the best skills in marketing, but you still need to understand the customers you’re trying to reach or even your own colleagues within the company,” she says. “I think that aspect is just as important as the business skills. That’s where Thunderbird fits in for me.”</p>\r\n<p>She credits Thunderbird’s <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/faculty-and-research\">faculty</a>, calling them “true practitioners of what they are teaching” because so many are consultants in addition to being teachers. “They’ve done extensive work outside of academia, and I really appreciate and respect that,” she says. “Their work is very relevant because they’re facing all the issues we’re going to face when we get out of the program.”</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><i>“Our faculty are true practitioners of what they are teaching. They’ve done extensive work outside of academia.” </i><i>– <a href=\"https://ctt.ec/2YqiT\">Click to tweet</a></i><i><a href=\"#_msocom_3\"></a><br></i></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Ashley plans to take advantage of Thunderbird’s many options for applied experiences, such as the <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/tem-lab\">Thunderbird Emerging Markets Lab.</a> “TEM Lab was another big draw for coming here,” she says. “It’s awesome that you can consult with a company on a real project that could lead to a job.”</p>\r\n<p>And she is ready with advice for anyone curious about Thunderbird: “If you have any interest at all, go to a <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/preview-day\">Campus Preview Day</a>. The Campus Ambassadors are so helpful. Being here and really interacting with people, you’ll see immediately how it’s different, and you’ll be hooked. You’ll already feel like you’re a part of Thunderbird.”</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, it’s those human connections that brought Ashley to Thunderbird. She notes the diverse backgrounds in her cohort, with students from Taiwan, Russia, Nigeria, Singapore, China, Colombia, and other countries. “We get so many perspectives – and that’s why I’m here.”</p>\r\n<h3>Learn more</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Meet Thunderbird’s team of <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/ca\">Campus Ambassadors</a></li>\r\n<li>Explore options in <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/tem-lab\">Thunderbird Emerging Markets (TEM) Lab</a></li>\r\n<li>And don’t forget to subscribe to the Knowledge Network newsletter!<span style=\"font-size: 1em; background-color: transparent;\">&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>"
