I’ll be aware of those, but my advice will be determined by facts on the ground. If those facts are unchanged, so my advice, too, will be unchanged.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“That was an interesting, tense moment.”</p>\r\n<blockquote>If carefully thought out principles guide your thinking at all times and you make that clear up front, your ideas will get serious consideration even when they differ from your colleagues or your boss. In the years after, your decision based on facts and moral courage will stand you in good stead while others may wish they had listened.</blockquote>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote\">2.

So be aware that your first thoughts may need to be refined, revised, shot and left by the side of the road, and you may have to do it all over again and again and again.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p\">“It also takes a great, great team, and everybody embracing the idea. Finally, there’s a little bit of the stubborn Dutchman in me, taking after my old Dutch sea captain father. It takes a high degree of determination.”</p>\r\n<blockquote>Leadership when viewed from close up has ebbs and flows. This is nothing more than the need to constantly react as shifting circumstances demand. The best leaders, Like General Petraeus, know that finding ways to sustain their focus and commitment in the face of adversity is key to achieving great things, including victories on the battlefield.</blockquote>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--blockquote\">3.

There was a moment when I just called up the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and said: ‘Hey, Admiral. I just want you to know this is not the easiest thing in the world.’ I just felt that somebody needs to know. That’s the final challenge, as they say, that’s the loneliness of command.”</p>\r\n<blockquote>A leader must learn to reach out across, up and down the organization, help colleagues to understand the challenges, and by doing so, find a sense of purpose, balance, and a way forward together.</blockquote>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"section-content\">\r\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\"><em>For the complete interview, click on the image below:</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\"><em>https://youtu.be/kkzzyZLoc6o</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div>Author’s Bio</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>Jeff Cunningham is an advocate for enlightened global leadership, which he calls the most valuable natural resource in the world.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>He is a Professor at ASU’s Thunderbird School of Global Management and was the former publisher of Forbes Magazine, startup founder, digital content CEO, and ran an internet venture capital fund.</div>\r\n<div></div>\r\n<div>He travels the globe in search of iconic leaders.
