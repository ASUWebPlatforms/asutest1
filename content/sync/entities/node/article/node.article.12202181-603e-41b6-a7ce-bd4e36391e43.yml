In fact, research shows that most people will tolerate a lot of pain with the status quo before switching. That’s why part of the <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/executive-education/programs/value-creation-and-winning\">Value Creation and Winning in the Global Arena</a> program is dedicated specifically to change. If you want to grow your market share and create more value for more people, you have to convince people to change.</p>\r\n<p>Thunderbird Marketing Professor Douglas Olsen describes the comprehensive change model (shown below) and explains the five laws that have to be met in order to tip the scale from the status quo to the new option.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><i>“If you want to grow your market share and create more value for more people, you have to convince people to change.” – <a href=\"https://ctt.ec/4IUcQ\">Click to tweet</a></i><a href=\"#_msocom_1\"></a><br><i></i></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h3>The 1st law: There must be superior value</h3>\r\n<p>Superior value is a subject we addressed in a recent Knowledge Network article, <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/knowledge-network/value-creation-all-about-customer\"><i>Value Creation: It Is ALL About Your Customer</i></a>. From creating your products and services to selling them, only one thing matters at the end of the day: the value you’re creating for the customer. People have many incentives <i>not </i>to change, and unless the alternative clearly offers superior value, they will have no incentive <i>to </i>change.</p>\r\n<h3>The 2nd law: The stability of the existing option must be reduced</h3>\r\n<p>While value creation is essential, it isn’t enough. You have to destabilize existing options and minimize the level of fear and uncertainty around the new alternative.</p>\r\n<p>Stability is driven by seven key factors:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Complacency (how much do people really care that there is a superior alternative)</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Contractual constraints (is it even possible for people to change)</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Un-portability (what will get left behind – e.g., related products, expertise, history)</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">System removal constraints (costs associated with changing)</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Breadth and depth of current use (how many people use the status quo, for how many purposes)</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Technical adequacy (how reliable is the status quo)</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"background-color: transparent;\">Relationships in place (with products, companies, brands, and/or individuals)</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Two examples of services that are particularly ‘sticky’ – that is, people are reluctant to change – are healthcare and banking, both of which are affected by many of those seven factors. Unsticking people from the status quo, then, requires chipping away at those stability factors.</p>\r\n<p>The first step is to ask: Are people aware of alternatives?\LWhat am I asking them to give up? Have there been recent changes? Are there constraints to removing the existing system? Do people really understand the shortcomings of the existing system? What important relationships are in place? Addressing those questions will help you reduce the stability of the existing option.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<i>“While value creation is essential, it isn’t enough.
