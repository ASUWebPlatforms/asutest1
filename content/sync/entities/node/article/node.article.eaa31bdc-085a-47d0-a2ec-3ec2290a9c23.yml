According to Deborah, women can&nbsp;confront and&nbsp;correct the self-defeating behaviors that hold them back.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3><span>Striving for Perfection</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>“Women professionals often want to be polished or perfect,” Shames said. “The truth is, audiences&nbsp;don’t trust a speaker who is&nbsp;<span>too</span>&nbsp;polished.&nbsp;Being perfect doesn’t create a connection with&nbsp;or engage an audience.”&nbsp;Shames explains,&nbsp;“Women strive for perfection out of fear. They&nbsp;feel compelled&nbsp;to do well. To be the good girl. And to make people proud.”&nbsp;Thus,&nbsp;they tend to over-prepare, write out, read,&nbsp;or memorize their talks. They tell themselves,&nbsp;“<span>I may be boring, but at least I won’t make a mistake or get it wrong.</span>”<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Instead, according to Shames,&nbsp;women should&nbsp;have a clear intention of what&nbsp;they&nbsp;want to achieve&nbsp;and tell&nbsp;themselves,&nbsp;“The audience needs&nbsp;what I have to deliver.”&nbsp;And then construct an outline. Think of it as&nbsp;a&nbsp;GPS to keep your speech&nbsp;on track and ensure that you cover your key talking points.&nbsp;The most successful speakers understand their job is to persuade rather than educate.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>As Deborah explains, “Don’t leave yourself out of your talk. Include&nbsp;‘I’&nbsp;statements that give your perspective, like&nbsp;‘I see… I know… I feel…’&nbsp;to better engage audiences.”&nbsp;I-statements&nbsp;will&nbsp;also reduce anxiety, because you always know where&nbsp;<span>you</span>&nbsp;stand on a topic. And rather than getting every word or phrase just right, strive to be conversational and natural.&nbsp;The&nbsp;audience will respond to a speaker’s authenticity.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3><span>If I’m&nbsp;Not an&nbsp;Expert,&nbsp;I&nbsp;Don’t Deserve to Speak</span></h3>\r\n<p>Too many women refuse to speak publicly, Shames believes,&nbsp;because they&nbsp;think&nbsp;they’re not an&nbsp;“Expert”&nbsp;or don’t know enough. News flash&nbsp;–&nbsp;we don’t do business with Experts, who can be boring, speak too long, and rarely include the speaker’s perspective.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Shames offers the following advice for mentally preparing,&nbsp;“Better to&nbsp;think of yourself as&nbsp;a Seasoned Veteran, Motivator, Coach,&nbsp;or Facilitator. It’s not about pretending to be someone else. It’s&nbsp;matching&nbsp;your experience or your comfort level with a&nbsp;mindset&nbsp;to best achieve your intention.”&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3><span>The&nbsp;Audience is Judging Me Harshly</span></h3>\r\n<p>“This one is a major roadblock for women, and patently untrue,” Shames&nbsp;says. Have you ever sat in an audience and wished that the speaker would be boring or fail completely? Of course not.&nbsp;The audience wants you to&nbsp;give them&nbsp;something of value, a useful takeaway, or&nbsp;an idea or concept&nbsp;that stimulates&nbsp;their intellect.&nbsp;“If you see serious faces in the audience, they are likely concentrating on what you are saying, and not judging you negatively.”&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Shames advises&nbsp;persistence. “The only way to move forward is to throw yourself into the fray of public speaking and power through, driving a strong intention with the confidence that you are improving each time you stand out front.”&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>“It’s time for women to create their own destinies,” concludes Shames.&nbsp;“Better communication and public speaking gives women the ability to seize every opportunity and aspire to new heights.&nbsp;Whether pitching for new business, delivering a talk at a conference, raising money for a favorite non-profit, or communicating one-on-one, women can become a powerful force when they speak with authenticity and confidence.”</p>\r\n<p><strong>Read More from Dana:<br></strong><a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/knowledge-network/5-tips-to-turn-your-hobby-into-a-powerhouse-career\">Entrepreneur, Solopreneur – It’s Not a Hobby Any More!</a><br><a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/knowledge-network/how-get-over-being-stressed-out-your-job-so-you-can-actually-do-it\">How to Get Over Being Stressed Out by Your Job So You Can Actually Do It<br></a><a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/knowledge-network/benefits-meditation-workplace\">Benefits of Meditation in the Workplace<br></a><a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/knowledge-network/new-manager-build-and-maintain-your-credibility\">New Manager?
