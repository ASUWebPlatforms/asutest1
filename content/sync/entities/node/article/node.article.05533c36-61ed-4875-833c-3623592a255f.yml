    value: "<p>TEM Lab, Fall 2018<br>Myanmar, Heho Potato<br>Written by Brandan Bornfield</p>\r\n<p>As the team wraps up our final week of TEM Lab, I reflect back on the multitude of experiences and blessings.&nbsp; I think of the items most profound and surprising.&nbsp; Growing up in a third world country and first world country, I rarely run into surprises on my travels.&nbsp; I’ve seen many people and countries at either end of the spectrum.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the people of Myanmar are truly surprising and inspiring.&nbsp; I have never felt so welcomed in a place I do not call home, but with this hospitality soon I found myself calling this place - home.&nbsp; Maybe it was the amount of time I spent away on TEM Lab, but I truly believe it was because of the familial treatment I received.</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"65719\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar \"},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar \"}},\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar\",\"title\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar \",\"style\":\"background-color: transparent; font-size: 1em;\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">Last Night in Myanmar with our Clients and their families</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>This perception of home slightly changed during our travels to Yangon, the old capital and most populous city in Myanmar.&nbsp; It is a massive city that’s nearly doubled in population size within the last 20 years, approximately 7.5 million as of 2017.&nbsp; It is a fast-paced city filled with an immense amount of ex-pats.&nbsp; The influx of populace, both domestic and foreign, have led the city to stray from its welcoming-nature for foreign people and investment to a society that is expectant to see the change initially promised.&nbsp; Compare this to the region of Shan State, specifically Heho, where we have been working with our client – Heho Potato Co. Ltd.&nbsp; The pace of life is much slower and level of involvement they have witnessed from foreign aid is minimal in comparison.&nbsp; These people do not expect this cooperation and participation from these foreign individuals, but they are truly honored to just have people come into their region to share the pride they have.&nbsp; This truly parallels the happenings across the world, due to the pace of life altering the perspectives of people globally.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"65720\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar \"},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"2\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar \"}},\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar\",\"title\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar \",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"2\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">Rooftop view of the big city Yangon Myanmar</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>As our Winrock International contact from France detailed, “Parisians are not very welcoming to anyone that is not a local, but if you go into the countryside, you will meet an entirely different type of French individual.” This holds true even when meeting people from the U.S.&nbsp; If you were to meet someone from New York or meeting someone a small town in the south, you are going to meet two, very different people that welcome strangers in alternative methods.</p>\r\n<p>Although this pace is paralleled, even in a society that is so new to the international stage, it is this exposure to globalism that alters the perspective.&nbsp; Thankfully, through my experiences in life and as a Thunderbird, I have been able to coalesce.&nbsp; This is the way of a true Thunderbird.&nbsp; This diplomacy is something that allows the positives of globalism to come to the forefront.&nbsp; All of us possess this global mentality, it is an innate human disposition.&nbsp; Yet it is up to us, as individuals, to preserve this disposition and allow it to affect us in a positive light.&nbsp; Thunderbird has always emphasized these values, but the responsibility to conduct ourselves with this cosmopolitan outlook may prove difficult in certain cases.&nbsp; Although, it doesn’t seem to prove as difficult for the individuals of this country. I’m just thankful to be on the receiving-end of such amazing people, and that I get to witness these parallels in a country with such different perceptions, paces, and peoples.</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"65721\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar \"},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"3\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar \"}},\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar\",\"title\":\"TEM Lab in Myanmar \",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"3\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">Final days working with Heho Potato late at night</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
