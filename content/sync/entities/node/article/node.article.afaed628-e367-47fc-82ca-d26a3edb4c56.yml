Most of you are teetering somewhere between exhilaration and trepidation. I know this because I was there.</p>\r\n<p>I imagine many of you, like me, have full-time jobs that continuously stretch beyond typical 40-hour weeks. Ever-growing work obligations and family responsibilities constrict our already short weeks, and now you are about to pile an equally time-consuming commitment onto your metaphorical plate.</p>\r\n<p>For myself, an average day starts out around 5:15 am, as the incessant screams of my alarm wake me up. I quickly get ready, scurry out the door, and head to the metro. I use the precious 30 or so minutes on the metro to catch up on some of the readings my professor has assigned. Once at work, the day flies by in a flurry of emails, calls, and meetings. When I get home sometime between 6:00 and 7:00 pm, I immediately start a Chinese lesson via Skype (which never seems to go as well as I would like). Finally, it’s time for homework, jumping back and forth among readings, video lectures, and projects. In between, I try to chat with my wife, hang out with my puppy, eat, exercise, and unwind. Sometime between 11:00 and midnight, when I just can’t keep my eyes open any longer, I crawl into bed and am whisked away to the land of slumber. And then before I know it, the cycle begins again.</p>\r\n<p>When I reached out to my cohort and asked them to write about their experience as an online student at Thunderbird — what their day-to-day life looks like and how they cope with the multiple roles that they inhabit — I was not surprised to learn that they had very similar experiences.</p>\r\n<h3><a href=\"http://dastornews.com/2017/09/learning-to-fly-online-a-letter-to-the-online-mgm-students/\" target=\"_blank\">Read the rest of the story...</a></h3>\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"7957\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Das Tor, Thunderbird Student Newspaper\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Das Tor, Thunderbird Student Newspaper\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Das Tor, Thunderbird Student Newspaper\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Das Tor, Thunderbird Student Newspaper\"}},\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Das Tor, Thunderbird Student Newspaper\",\"title\":\"Das Tor, Thunderbird Student Newspaper\",\"style\":\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"},\"link_text\":null}]]</p>"
