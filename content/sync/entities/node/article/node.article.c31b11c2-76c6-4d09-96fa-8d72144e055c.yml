    value: "<h4><i>Co-authors: Sanjeev Khagram, Ph.D. and Jeff Cunningham, Professor of Practice</i></h4>\r\n<h4>The most admired leadership qualities are “magic wands” or “halos.”</h4>\r\n<p>Magic wands bring to mind leaders like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk. The two iconic change-makers seem to be able to point at goals like shared music and electric vehicles and “presto” they became realities. That expresses the essence of what we admire in a leader. The “halo” attributes refer to things like corporate social responsibility that may give people a greater sense of purpose.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Quality commitment</li>\r\n<li>Trustworthy</li>\r\n<li>Customer care</li>\r\n<li>Employee care</li>\r\n<li>Visionary</li>\r\n<li>Innovation</li>\r\n<li>Environmental responsibility</li>\r\n<li>Financial performance</li>\r\n<li>Community involvement</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h4>The Top Attribute for the Most Admired CEO</h4>\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"76209\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":false,\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":false,\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false}},\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]</p>\r\n<p>The chart shows the main source of admiration for each CEO.</p>\r\n<p>The findings reveal that admiration is correlated with high levels of trust, employee and customer care, and high-quality products. The reason is simple. These are “CEO-centric,” meaning they are traceable back to a leader’s thinking and policies. People are likely to give them credit for these qualities, whereas a leader focused on social causes may not benefit as much.</p>\r\n<h4>The Most Admired Dimensions</h4>\r\n<p>We took the nine attributes and condensed them into five dimensions: Trust and Reliability, Empathy (for employees and customers), Personal Dynamism (innovation, creativity, and vision), Social Responsibility (environment and community), and Wall Street (financial performance).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;[[{\"fid\":\"76210\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":false,\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"2\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":false,\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false}},\"attributes\":{\"style\":\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"2\"}}]]</p>\r\n<p>The conclusion is that admiration is like author Han Suyin’s famous novel, a many-splendored thing, and most correlated with trust, empathy, and personal dynamism. These are useful as a guide to what people like, who they invest with, and want to work for.</p>\r\n<h4>The Top CEOs By Attribute</h4>\r\n<p>We also looked at each leadership quality and ranked the best performing CEOs.</p>\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"76212\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":false,\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"3\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":false,\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false}},\"attributes\":{\"style\":\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"3\"}}]]</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Buffett’s admiration is unprecedented across all dimensions, including social responsibility, where he ties Tim Cook for #1.</li>\r\n<li>Given Tim Cook’s relatively short tenure compared to Buffett and Bezos, his rank of first or second in trust, customer care, and social responsibility, is a great showing.</li>\r\n<li>Bezos is a brilliant leader who has made his mark in dynamic qualities like innovation and vision.</li>\r\n<li>Jamie Dimon is the only banker to make it into the top five.</li>\r\n<li>Elon Musk is one of three CEOs to make it to the top five across all dimensions.</li>\r\n<li>Satya Nadella scores high on all dimensions even as he competes against CEOs with longer tenures like Tim Cook and Jeff Bezos.</li>\r\n<li>Ginni Rometty’s (social responsibility) and Sundar Pichai’s (employee care) appearance in the top five suggests they have staked out their territory and are seeing results.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Co-authors:</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/sanjeev-khagram\">Sanjeev Khagram</a>&nbsp;is a world-renowned scholar in global business studies.
