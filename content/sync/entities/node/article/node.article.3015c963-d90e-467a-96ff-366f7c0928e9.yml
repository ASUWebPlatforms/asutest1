He is eager to utilize his experience in sales and sales management to help Solar Sister accomplish its goals over the next several weeks.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Tash</strong>, optimistic and solution oriented individual, has a wide variety of work experience including sales, training, and marketing. His travel experience, open-minded attitude, and passion for empowering people make him adaptable and useful.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Neha</strong>, the co-lead of the team, looks forward to continuing her contribution towards woman empowerment through this project with her marketing and sales experience. She promises to use her ‘mahout’ skills to drive the elephant and save the day, should the occasion arise.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dawson</strong>, the diplomat of the group, looks forward to returning to Africa. His previous experience living and working in Africa will prove valuable as the team gets on the ground.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Caleb</strong>&nbsp;is a true global citizen with experience in over four continents and three languages. Skills gained from this diverse background to include the military will be highly applicable to the local context of Tanzania and Solar Sister.</p>"
