    value: "<p>The best things in life are free; one, in fact, is changing the world.</p>\r\n<p><span>On April 8, 1946, Thunderbird School of Global Management (originally known as the American Institute for Foreign Trade [AIFT]) was chartered on the Glendale, Ariz. World War II airbase, Thunderbird Field No. 1, where pilots from around the world came for training during wartime. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Lt. General Barton Kyle Yount obtained the airfield with the express purpose of developing a school focused exclusively on international trade and global relations. The airfield—which was valued at $407,000—was acquired at a 100% discount (i.e., a gift), which raised eyebrows around the nation until congressmen on the House Surplus Property Committee deemed that <strong>not only did Thunderbird qualify for the nonprofit discount, but that its existence would actually contribute to the cause of world peace</strong>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>Yount was named Thunderbird’s first president, and established a vision for the school that remains today.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span><span><span><span>Built on the phrase coined by original faculty member Dr. William Lytle Schurz:<strong> “Borders frequented by trade seldom need soldiers,”</strong> Thunderbird’s mission to “educate global leaders who create sustainable prosperity worldwide” was born.</span></span></span></span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"4822\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird Military History\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird Military History\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird Military History\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird Military History\"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Thunderbird Military History\",\"title\":\"Thunderbird Military History\",\"style\":\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]</p>\r\n<p><span><span>But before the school embarked on its now 70+ year journey in international business education, the world-changing Thunderbird Field No. 1 already had high aspirations—even simply in its architectural layout which was designed to look from the air like an etching of a mythical Anasazi Thunderbird, the airfield was a 640 acre, square property within which was a 5,280' square base all-way field, with a 2,582' x 1,850' oiled mat in the northwest corner, and 3 dirt runways (the longest of which were the 3,200' northeast/southwest &amp; northwest/southeast strips).</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span>[[{\"fid\":\"4823\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird Military History\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird Military History\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird Military History\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird Military History\"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Thunderbird Military History\",\"title\":\"Thunderbird Military History\",\"style\":\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Army Air Force signed a contract with Southwest Airways, no relation to Southwest&nbsp;Airlines, to provide instructors and facilities for a primary training school for its aviation cadets in March 1941, beginning with a class of 59 candidates. Eventually, 10,000 pilots from&nbsp;</span>three nations (the United States, China, and the United Kingdom) trained at the field before it was deactivated in June 1945.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span>It was less than a year later that Thunderbird—as a school—would take over the hallowed grounds of the military base known worldwide for embracing international pilots. </span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><span>By 1955, Thunderbird offered two unique degrees: a Bachelor of Foreign Trade and a Master of Foreign Trade. Over the years, the Bachelor’s program was discontinued and the Master’s program morphed into a Master of International Management (MIM). In 2001, the MIM was adapted into an MBA in Global Management to respond to the growing demand for graduates with a business administration focus. During those same years, Thunderbird expanded its degree program offerings to include an online MBA, an executive MBA and early-career master’s degrees like the Master of Arts in Global Affairs &amp; Management. As the business and academic worlds continued to evolve, Thunderbird returned to its roots—shifting its MBA back to a specialized Master of Global Management and relaunching its Bachelor’s programs in global management and foreign trade. </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Now a unit of the Arizona State University Knowledge Enterprise, Thunderbird Field No. 1&nbsp;continues to play a valuable role in the local and global community. </span></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><span>Like the pilots during WWII, students from Thunderbird hail from around the world (over the last 5 years, more than 90 nations have been represented on campus). And, still, the welcoming nature of Thunderbird Field No. 1—which saw the value in cross-cultural interaction and the proud impact of internationalism—remains today.</span></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>"
