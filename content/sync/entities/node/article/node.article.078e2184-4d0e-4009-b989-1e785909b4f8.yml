And this partnership is committed to backing women entrepreneurs because when they win, we all win.</p><h3>Signing Ceremony in Phoenix</h3><p>Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs Marie Royce, ASU President Michael Crow, and Freeport-McMoRan Foundation President Tracy Bame signed the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) recently in Phoenix. The MOU represents a commitment to developing the skills of prospective women entrepreneurs, through the Academy for Women Entrepreneurs (<a href="https://eca.state.gov/awe#about">AWE</a>), by utilizing the DreamBuilder online learning program, which was jointly developed by Freeport-McMoRan and Thunderbird.</p><p>“AWE is a proven and successful global program empowering women entrepreneurs,” said Assistant Secretary Royce. “We’ve been inspired by AWE stories around the world and are excited to expand the program to over 50 countries this year with the support of key partnerships like this one.”</p><blockquote><p><i>“ ‘</i>We’ve been inspired by AWE stories around the world and are excited to expand the program to over 50 countries<i>.’ ~ Marie Royce, Assistant Secretary of State”&nbsp;–&nbsp;<a href="https://ctt.ec/0Y771">Click to tweet</a></i><i><a href="applewebdata://8B4F6476-5083-4478-8D75-10633423D046#_msocom_1" id="_anchor_1" name="_msoanchor_1"></a><br></i></p></blockquote><h3>Quick Success and Growth&nbsp;</h3><p>In 2019, the State Department’s Educational and Cultural Affairs group created and launched AWE to support the White House-led Women’s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative.

Even more impressive is that women are starting businesses on their own terms – whether it be their full-time focus or a part time activity,” said Courtney Kelso, Senior Vice President of American Express.&nbsp;</p><p>The annual American Express-funded report on women entrepreneurs&nbsp;based on U.S. Census Bureau data adjusted by Gross Domestic Product data, found that women-owned businesses continue to trend above all businesses.&nbsp;Over the past five years:</p><ul><li>The number of women-owned businesses increased 21%, while all businesses increased only 9%.</li><li>Total employment by women-owned businesses rose 8%, while for all businesses the increase was far lower at 1.8%.</li><li>Total revenue for women-owned businesses also rose slightly above all businesses: 21% compared to 20% respectively.</li></ul><p>While female-run enterprises are steadily growing all over the world, contributing to household incomes and growth of national economies, women still face challenges in maintaining successful enterprises due to lack of funding, fewer skills, and social constraints.</p><p>That’s where AWE’s global network steps in.&nbsp;AWE is built to be sustainable by taking advantage of the State Department’s global network of embassies. Localized partnerships around the world will amplify the course experience and provide opportunities for women to continue advancing as leading entrepreneurs.</p>'
