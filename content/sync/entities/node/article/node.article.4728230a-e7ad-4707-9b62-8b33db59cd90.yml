Then, you can drop the toys off to a local YMCA, Toys for Tots, or similar charity. Not only will this remove stress about holiday giving in the office, but it will increase holiday spirit and joy in the office.”&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3><span>Give the best gift of all: Time off.&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>“Research has found that employees say ‘time away from the office’ as their favorite thing that employers give them this time of year. If you don’t have the funds for bonuses or a big holiday party, simply giving the team an extra day off or even half-a-day can go a long way in inspiring goodwill. Even turning the week of Christmas into a ‘casual dress’ week can help employees to feel relaxed and appreciated by the boss.”<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:true,&quot;134233118&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>In addition to&nbsp;these bits of advice,&nbsp;be sure to take time to walk around and say,&nbsp;“Thank you for working so hard for our company,” to your&nbsp;staff.
