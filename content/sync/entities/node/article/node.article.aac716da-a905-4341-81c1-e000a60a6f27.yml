Smart Yields uses IoT, the Internet of Things, to help keep an eye on those fields.&nbsp;</p><p>Smart Yields is the agtech brainchild of Kimura and a team of investors and entrepreneurs based in Hawaii. Kimura, who graduated in 2010 from Thunderbird’s MBA (Masters in Global Management) program, founded Smart Yields in 2015.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>“ ‘</i><i>Smart Yields tripled the time I had to save my Honeycrisp crop, worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.’ ~ Edward Tuft, Colorado fruit grower”&nbsp;<a href="https://ctt.ec/3Q311">Click to tweet</a></i><i><a href="applewebdata://C6C4923E-EC10-4DC7-B627-31B755D2DA1F#_msocom_1" id="_anchor_1" name="_msoanchor_1"></a><br></i></p></blockquote><p>The cloud-based software system uses&nbsp;a combination of analytics and in-field monitoring devices to help small- and mid-size farmers increase output and reduce risks. By using sensors to measure, predict, and alert farmers to current and trending environmental conditions, Smart Yields provides them with insights and analysis to help protect crops and increase yields.</p><p>Kimura, lead founder and CEO of Smart Yields, was born in Honolulu and raised across Hawaii and Asia. He received a degree in environmental science from Oregon State University before heading to Thunderbird School of Global Management. Most recently, he was CEO of Inovi Green, a Hawaii-based company that helps implement clean energy and sustainable technology solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>A relatively young company, Smart Yields, has already received international attention.&nbsp;The company was part of the sixth cohort of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bluestartups.com/">Blue Startups&nbsp;accelerator program</a>; was selected for the 2017 cohort of the&nbsp;<a href="https://elementalexcelerator.com/companies/smart-yields/">Elemental Excelerator</a>, and was one of nine companies from around the world to present in the inaugural&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bluestartups.com/blog/smart-yields-in-first-round-of-vaticans-inaugural-accelerator-program/">Laudato Si’ Challenge&nbsp;tech accelerator</a>&nbsp;in Rome.&nbsp;</p><h3>Kimura’s family and business roots&nbsp;</h3><p>Kimura traces his farming roots to his grandfather, who moved from Japan to Kauai to work in the sugarcane fields on the northernmost island of the Hawaii chain.&nbsp;</p><p>Truly a lifelong learner, Kimura’s&nbsp;almost 20 years of education and entrepreneurial and industry experience has been built on his interest in technology and sustainability. “We need data to understand where we are in terms of farms, production, safety, and crop conditions,” Kimura told the Pacific Business News.</p><blockquote><p><i>“</i><i>Kimura, who traces his farming roots to his grandfather who moved from Japan to Kauai to work in the sugarcane fields, has created what he calls the ‘Fitbit for Farmers.’&nbsp;”&nbsp;<a href="https://ctt.ec/jG5x1">Click to tweet</a></i><i><a href="applewebdata://C6C4923E-EC10-4DC7-B627-31B755D2DA1F#_msocom_2" id="_anchor_2" name="_msoanchor_2"></a><br></i><i></i></p></blockquote><p>Before heading to Thunderbird, Kimura worked as an Asia-Pacific accounts manager at KPMG, where he became interested in learning more about knowledge management and transfer. “That’s what Smart Yields is all about,” he says, “helping small- and mid-size farmers collect and use shared data for the benefit of the region. With this data, they can more confidently predict and tackle challenges and strengthen relationships with other farmers.”</p><h3>Coming to the aid of the farmers</h3><p>U.S. farmers are nowhere near the depths of the 1980s farm crisis and, overall, farm income is actually up, thanks to federal payments. Yet&nbsp;<a href="https://www.farmaid.org/blog/fact-sheet/understanding-economic-crisis-family-farms-are-facing/">farmers are enduring a six-year slump in crop</a>&nbsp;and livestock prices that is causing stress in other areas: investment in equipment is down, farmer debt is up, and so is borrowing against farmland.&nbsp;</p><p>Trade disputes and tariffs, soil conditions, drought, natural and man-made disasters, and a changing workforce. All of these contribute to the dramatic circumstances impacting farmers in the U.S. and beyond.</p><p>Any help is welcomed. You may think of farmers as early-rising, old-school, do-it-yourself traditionalists. That’s true to an extent, but they can also be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/03/170314135442.htm">early adopters</a>. And as you look across the agriculture landscape, a number of agtech start-ups are hoping to come to their rescue. One of them, a successful one, is brought to you by T-bird’s Vincent Kimura.&nbsp;<i style="font-size: 1em;">&nbsp;</i></p><div><div><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></div>'
