Job development and employment&nbsp;edged up by 103,000 in March, and the&nbsp;unemployment rate&nbsp;was unchanged at 4.1 percent,&nbsp;according to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf\">Labor Department</a>.&nbsp;The&nbsp;momentum is great for job seekers and should come as welcome news to many. Especially since&nbsp;the majority of Americans are dissatisfied with their current position according to a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://careerstudy.visualcv.com/\">new survey</a>&nbsp;from résumé&nbsp;and portfolio creation platform&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.visualcv.com/\">VisualCV</a>.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>While more than three out of five of Americans indicated that they are unsatisfied with their jobs, they are extremely optimistic about the prospects of a career change. Does this scenario sound familiar?&nbsp;James Clift, CEO of&nbsp;VisualCV, believes that optimism may very well be the most important asset a candidate can possess when looking to secure a job. He and I recently&nbsp;discussed&nbsp;how Americans really feel about the job market and,&nbsp;more important, ways candidates can get a jump start on the competition.</p>\r\n<h4>According to the survey, 69 percent of Americans indicated that they are unsatisfied with their job. What would you recommend to these unsatisfied people?</h4>\r\n<p>The first thing&nbsp;I’d recommend is for them&nbsp;to realize that they’re not alone! It’s a common problem, and a complex one. I recommend people dig deep into the causes of&nbsp;their dissatisfaction&nbsp;before immediately looking for a new job.</p>\r\n<p>What are you unsatisfied with? It could be the work you’re doing, the work environment, the hours, your boss, your workload, your paycheck&nbsp;–&nbsp;anything. Typically, people who are satisfied with their jobs have achieved three important milestones: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Use this framework to evaluate what exactly is missing in your position. Once you isolate the problem, you can then begin working on the solution.</p>\r\n<p><span><i>Take away: Identify the problem(s) that are impacting your job satisfaction.</i></span></p>\r\n<h4>That is helpful, but once someone identifies what is lacking,&nbsp;what can they do about it?</h4>\r\n<p>Once you know the biggest cause of your dissatisfaction (or what you&nbsp;think is the biggest problem), then start outlining the steps to solve it. Realize that anything is achievable whether it’s a 40 percent pay raise, more flexible working hours,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.visualcv.com/blog/suffering-from-professional-value-fuzziness/\">understanding your value</a>, or even a complete career&nbsp;redirection. It’s never too late to get what you want from your job provided you can identify what it is you are missing&nbsp;in&nbsp;the one you have&nbsp;and what you hope to achieve from the next one.</p>\r\n<p>Once you’ve&nbsp;identified the problem and set your goals,&nbsp;begin taking small steps towards accomplishing your plan every day. These don’t have to be intimidating changes; they&nbsp;can be as simple as making a point to meet with someone new in your industry every week or sending your resume to a company that interests you.</p>\r\n<p>Learning something new that piques your interest can also&nbsp;give you a&nbsp;kickstart when searching for a new&nbsp;career. The best option for this is to enroll in a class or an online course. Some great options are&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lynda.com/\">Lynda</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://skillshare.com/\">Skillshare</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://teamtreehouse.com/\">Treehouse</a>.</p>\r\n<p>For more complex causes of dissatisfaction, and especially for those you don’t feel equipped to work through on your own, consider seeking support from a reputable career development professional in your area.</p>\r\n<p><span><i>Take away: Set yourself up for success by addressing the issues that may be holding you back. And when stuck, consider consulting with a career professional.</i></span></p>\r\n<h4>People are&nbsp;optimistic&nbsp;and&nbsp;96 percent&nbsp;are&nbsp;open to a new job according to your study. How can this improve their chances of finding something new this year?<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></h4>\r\n<p>Embrace that optimism but again be sure to prioritize your career goals. Having a plan is key to finding your ideal job so take the time to determine what exactly it is that you want to accomplish this year. I recommend taking a full inventory of your current skills, and a list of potential jobs you are interested in. Find the places where those intersect as a starting point for&nbsp;your&nbsp;career search.</p>\r\n<p>Once you have the end goal in mind, start small. An easy first step is to update your&nbsp;résumé&nbsp;and polish up all online profiles. Remember to keep your dream job in mind when doing&nbsp;so, and&nbsp;remember that both your&nbsp;résumé&nbsp;and online brand are living breathing documents that can (and should) be updated frequently.</p>\r\n<p>Then set aside some time every day to explore new opportunities. This exploration can be in various forms – online job boards, social networks, or in-person events.</p>\r\n<p>Take steps to ensure your mind and network are fresh as this is essential when trying to make a change. Attend local events in your area, and keep the conversation going online. Use networks such as LinkedIn to build a robust network of valuable contacts that can help you in your upcoming job search.</p>\r\n<p>Remember that the smallest connections can lead to the biggest changes, and try to maximize those small connections. The biggest thing keeping you from making a change is you. Simply taking action is always the best approach.</p>\r\n<p><span><i>Take away: Prioritize your career goals.

Are there areas of growth that you’ve seen or are anticipating this year?</h4>\r\n<p>I will default to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/ooh/mobile/fastest-growing.htm\">Bureau of&nbsp;Labor</a>&nbsp;on this one.&nbsp;The rise in clean energy has resulted in new jobs like&nbsp;wind turbine service technicians, solar panel installers, and others, many of which don’t&nbsp;require a college degree.</p>\r\n<p>Anything in Information Technology is also a good bet;&nbsp;software is continuing to gain traction, and&nbsp;people who understand software will be well sought-after in the upcoming years. This doesn’t mean you need to become a software engineer, but it could mean applying skills&nbsp;developed&nbsp;in a more traditional industry to a technology company. For example, instead of working in a traditional wealth management firm,&nbsp;you could work for a robo-advisor such as WealthFront.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span><i>Take away: Consider how your skills transfer from traditional industries to up-and-coming ones.</i></span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Join Dana Manciagli’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://danamanciagl.samcart.com/referral/ihc4Zdak/mHDAKfwajfZgTWDa\">Job Search Master Class</a>&nbsp;right now and immediately access the most comprehensive job search system currently available!</strong></h3>\r\n<p><em>Thunderbird School of Global Management Alumna Dana Manciagli '84 is the author of \"Cut the crap, Get a job\".
