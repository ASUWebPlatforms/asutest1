Regional Nights happen at least once each semester and celebrate the food, culture, traditions, art and performance of a particular region of the world--with students from that region sharing their culture with their classmates and others in the Thunderbird community.</p>\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"5785\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird School of Global Management Wants to Celebrate Your Culture &amp; Traditions\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird School of Global Management Wants to Celebrate Your Culture &amp; Traditions\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird School of Global Management Wants to Celebrate Your Culture &amp; Traditions\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird School of Global Management Wants to Celebrate Your Culture &amp; Traditions\"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Thunderbird School of Global Management Wants to Celebrate Your Culture &amp; Traditions\",\"title\":\"Thunderbird School of Global Management Wants to Celebrate Your Culture &amp; Traditions\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]</p>\r\n<p>During Regional Nights, all hands are on deck, from the students who welcome the guests at the entrance with warm smiles, to the student leaders who serve the food. This, after all, is our way of displaying our Thunderbird pride and our rich legacy of a global mindset borne out of diversity. This diversity is fully displayed, with students dressed in different national costumes representing the cultures being celebrated at the event. There is often a lot of laughter, as student see their friends in a new light, far from the classroom attire and more serious mood. And by the end of the night, there is a lot of clapping and dancing, as everyone gets into the spirit.</p>\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"5786\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird School of Global Management Wants to Celebrate Your Culture &amp; Traditions\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird School of Global Management Wants to Celebrate Your Culture &amp; Traditions\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird School of Global Management Wants to Celebrate Your Culture &amp; Traditions\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird School of Global Management Wants to Celebrate Your Culture &amp; Traditions\"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Thunderbird School of Global Management Wants to Celebrate Your Culture &amp; Traditions\",\"title\":\"Thunderbird School of Global Management Wants to Celebrate Your Culture &amp; Traditions\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]</p>\r\n<p>In the end, Regional Nights are the perfect opportunity to get out of the dorms, leave behind those business books and experience new activities, listen to music from other lands, and eat new foods right here on campus. Billy Joel is definitely right when he says, “I think music in itself is healing. It's an explosive expression of humanity. It's something we are all touched by. No matter what culture we're from, everyone loves music.”</p>\r\n<p>And in a world where many seek to build borders, it helps to have a place like Thunderbird where people feel at home in diversity, and are willing to explore and try new things. So what are you waiting for? Come and join this community that goes beyond borders and sees humanity more clearly.</p>\r\n<p>By Bethany Chijindu '17, Master of Global Management&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-break\">&nbsp;</p>"
