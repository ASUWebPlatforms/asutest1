    value: "<p>There are so many issues in this world that need to be addressed. Complex problems that impact so many lives are often the toughest to tackle, especially when lives are at stake. From equal rights to poverty to gun violence and sexual assault, we all agree that something needs to be done, but how?</p>\r\n<p>In order to light a fire you need a spark. Similarly to prompt change you need a change agent. Someone that will, at just the right time, step into the gap and take a stand.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>It doesn’t have to be huge, but one small step in the right direction that can impact the lives of a community, a province, a nation or even the world. Sometimes change begins with a woman.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>From Rosa Parks to the women of the #metoo movement, each played a pivotal role in bringing about positive change in our world. So too are the women of <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/global-impact/project-artemis-afghanistan\">Project Artemis</a>, a transformative initiative by <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu\">Thunderbird School of Global Management</a> that offers Afghan women entrepreneurs with intensive business training and mentoring.</p>\r\n<p>This week in celebration of <a href=\"https://www.internationalwomensday.com/\" target=\"_blank\">International Women’s Day</a> on March 8, we would like to highlight graduates of Project Artemis who represent a face of positive change. These and many other women who have participated in the <a href=\"/node/285\">Thunderbird for Good</a> Project Artemis program have dramatically changed their lives and impacted their communities for generations to come. They are catalysts for positive change, change that encourages stability and peace in their communities.</p>\r\n<p>But this is just the tip of the iceberg. Many more women need the skills and encouragement that will help them take the necessary steps to start or expand their businesses. You can help them on their journey by supporting Project Artemis. <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/global-impact/project-artemis-afghanistan\">Learn more about Project Artemis</a> and how you can support mentoring programs for Afghan women entrepreneurs.</p>\r\n<div class=\"fancy-divider\"></div>\r\n<h3>Aziza Mohmand</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/dVLjwXTCmYo\" style=\"background-color: transparent; font-size: 1em;\">Aziza Mohmand</a><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-size: 1em;\"> was a teacher in Kabul Afghanistan. When the Taliban took over she ran an underground school. She recognized the need for education and jobs for women but there were not many opportunities for them. She had an idea for a business producing leather products such as soccer balls. She participated in Project Artemis to improve her business skills in order to expand her company. She now employs more than 200 people – many of them women – who are earning a living and bringing stability to her community.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-size: 1em;\">[[{\"fid\":\"13617\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\"},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"3\":{\"format\":\"default\"}},\"attributes\":{\"style\":\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"3\"}}]]</span></p>\r\n<p>#gendergap #afghanistan #womenintech #startup #entrepreneur #changeagent #women @susanaumack @projectartemis @thunderbird</p>\r\n<p><em>About the author: Susan Aumack is a software marketing executive, mentor </em>and alumna<em> of Thunderbird.
