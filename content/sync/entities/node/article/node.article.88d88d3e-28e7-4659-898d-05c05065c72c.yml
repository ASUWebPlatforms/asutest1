    value: "<p>By Tim Weaver<br>Thunderbird Executive Education</p>\r\n<p>When it comes to leadership, there is no dearth of advice on how to be a good leader. In fact, GE’s famed Change Acceleration Process (CAP) summed up the key to leadership in a simple formula: E=Q*A, where E equals solution effectiveness, Q is the quality of a solution and A is the solution’s acceptance.</p>\r\n<p>And although it appears straightforward, leadership really isn’t as simple as that, says leadership development expert Lee Ann Del Carpio.</p>\r\n<p>“Leadership can’t be reduced to a formula measured by discrete factors,” said Del Carpio, an Executive Education faculty member at Thunderbird School of Global Management in Arizona. “There is much more to it.”</p>\r\n<p>The results a leader obtains is directly tied to the solution’s quality, but great ideas will go nowhere if they’re not accepted.</p>\r\n<p>“But often more important than if the idea is accepted, it’s who accepts it,” she said. “As a solution increases in complexity and uncertainty, acceptance becomes more important.”</p>\r\n<p>What can you do to become a better leader, to foster greater solution acceptance and increase effectiveness? Del Carpio offers these suggestions:</p>\r\n<p>• Get your people on the ground who closest to your customers involved early in the process. <br>• Listen to others and solicit feedback. This can help increase buy-in, but has to be authentic.<br>• Prioritize listening. While it’s time-consuming, you have to balance whether getting buy-in early is better than driving a solution through and hoping to get buy-in later.<br>• Understand you can be blinded by the light of what you already know. Confirmation bias increases as the speed of change increases.<br>• Realize you’re likely to be uncomfortable. Some people are more interested in complaining than problem-solving.<br>• Challenge any long-standing business assumptions. What if they’re less relevant than they used to be?</p>\r\n<p>One final thing to remember, says Del Carpio, is that solution acceptance isn’t limited to within your organization.</p>\r\n<p>“While it’s important that you get buy-in from your internal stakeholders, you need to remember that the marketplace, meaning your customers, ultimately have to like it, too.”</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/node/2010\">Lee Ann Del Carpio</a> is a faculty member for Thunderbird’s Executive Education program and an expert in global leadership development, an executive coach and a sought-after facilitator of strategic cultural change.&nbsp;</p>"
