Instead, they must&nbsp;become better coaches;&nbsp;supporting, motivating,&nbsp;and playing to the individual strengths of their team members&nbsp;in the way that resonates&nbsp;best&nbsp;with each individual.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>However, adjusting to this new management style can be a challenge&nbsp;for some who are steeped in the “old ways” of leadership.&nbsp;Becoming a better coach requires changing your perspective&nbsp;– on&nbsp;both yourself and your team.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>To get some insight on how to make the shift, I&nbsp;e-mailed with&nbsp;Joanne Wells, a senior HR leader&nbsp;and&nbsp;expert in modern performance management, from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.halogensoftware.com/\">Halogen Software</a>. Joanne&nbsp;shared these tips on how&nbsp;you can&nbsp;become a better manager by improving your coaching skills.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3><span>Understand why coaching matters.</span></h3>\r\n<p>Employees want&nbsp;to be part of a&nbsp;culture&nbsp;where&nbsp;they can learn and grow as individuals and feel that their contributions have value beyond profitability. Which, when you think about it, isn’t really all that revolutionary. In all aspects of life, don’t we all want to be&nbsp;treated&nbsp;as individuals who matter instead of&nbsp;as&nbsp;cogs&nbsp;in a&nbsp;system&nbsp;whose only purpose is to serve someone else’s needs?&nbsp;If you don’t provide that kind of supportive environment, your team will stagnate like hamsters in a wheel—working&nbsp;hard&nbsp;but not really going anywhere. Soon they’ll be dissatisfied&nbsp;and head for the door.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3><span>Be willing to&nbsp;adapt.</span></h3>\r\n<p>Don’t assume that&nbsp;your management approach is the best. Conduct self-assessments to better understand yourself&nbsp;as a leader&nbsp;– your&nbsp;communication style, your intrinsic motivators,&nbsp;and&nbsp;how&nbsp;<span>you</span>&nbsp;want to be recognized and rewarded.&nbsp;Then,&nbsp;recognize&nbsp;that not everyone will—nor should they—share your perspective. It’s not their job to change how they want to be treated to fit your&nbsp;leadership&nbsp;style. It’s your job to tailor your approach based on their needs. In order to change&nbsp;your team’s&nbsp;behavior&nbsp;and&nbsp;improve their performance,&nbsp;it may be you who needs to change.</p>\r\n<h3><span>Get to know the whole person.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>Set aside time to really get to know your team, both inside&nbsp;of work&nbsp;and outside. Learn about their passions and interests and&nbsp;how they balance work and&nbsp;personal life. Then,&nbsp;use that&nbsp;insight to inspire&nbsp;and&nbsp;motivate&nbsp;them.&nbsp;For example, if&nbsp;an&nbsp;employee is passionate about technology,&nbsp;figure out&nbsp;how to channel that interest&nbsp;in a way that they enjoy but&nbsp;that&nbsp;also&nbsp;helps&nbsp;the business.</p>\r\n<h3><span>Remember&nbsp;that&nbsp;your purpose is to help&nbsp;others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>Too many leaders&nbsp;think, “How can I get&nbsp;my&nbsp;employees to do what reflects well on ME as a leader?”&nbsp;If that’s your purpose,&nbsp;people&nbsp;will see through it,&nbsp;and you’ll lose their trust. Instead, your focus&nbsp;must&nbsp;genuinely&nbsp;be to&nbsp;improve the&nbsp;performance of&nbsp;your team.&nbsp;Your&nbsp;role&nbsp;is to help&nbsp;them&nbsp;grow&nbsp;in both their careers&nbsp;and in life, to feel valued as a person&nbsp;and&nbsp;not just for their productivity/output.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"></span><span>Always&nbsp;address “what’s&nbsp;next?”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>In&nbsp;each interaction with your team, it’s important to establish&nbsp;a follow-up action.&nbsp;If an issue or obstacle arises for an employee,&nbsp;talk–in that moment–about&nbsp;what the two of you can do to 1) resolve it and 2) prevent it from happening again.&nbsp;Working together to develop solutions and&nbsp;remove barriers not only demonstrates your commitment to helping your employees succeed, but also that you value their input and suggestions.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3><span>Give them room to experiment.</span></h3>\r\n<p>As a manager and coach, it’s not your job to&nbsp;provide&nbsp;the&nbsp;answers to everything.&nbsp;Instead, provide&nbsp;a&nbsp;supportive environment&nbsp;where your employees can figure things out on their own and,&nbsp;if they do fail, can learn from&nbsp;the experience.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Being a successful manager is no longer about what you can get out of your employees. It’s about how you can help them succeed as employees—and as people—which, in turn,&nbsp;will help the company&nbsp;thrive.&nbsp;Adopting&nbsp;an employee-centric coaching&nbsp;approach&nbsp;is essential to&nbsp;empowering&nbsp;your team to perform at their best and achieve their fullest potential.</p>\r\n<p>Join Dana Manciagli’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://danamanciagl.samcart.com/referral/ihc4Zdak/mHDAKfwajfZgTWDa\"><span>Job Search Master Class</span></a>&nbsp;right now and immediately access the most comprehensive job search system currently available!</p>\r\n<p><em>Thunderbird School of Global Management Alumna Dana Manciagli '84 is the author of \"Cut the crap, Get a job\".
