Photo Credit: Random Stranger</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>On August 24th, 2018, Team HAIR+Z embarked on a journey to Cluj-Napoca, Romania. The project was slated to last five weeks, but we quickly learned the memories would last a lifetime. When we initially boarded the plane in Phoenix we were not sure how the experience would unfold, but we sure were excited. Here we are now, five weeks later, looking back on an experience none of us could have imagined would be so rich.</p>\r\n<p>Our focus in week five turned fully toward gaining adoption. As consultants, our goal was to provide solutions that would allow the client to achieve a future otherwise not attainable. However, without their willingness to adopt the provided solutions, our efforts would be wasted. Needless to say, it was an important week.</p>\r\n<p>We were to give our final presentation to the client on Thursday. The early part of the week was spent preparing the final product and walking the management team through our recommended solutions. One might think the recommendations should be withheld until the final presentation to “wow” the client. We took an alternate approach: collaboratively engage the client throughout the project to avoid a “big reveal” that could have left the client scrambling if the solutions were not in line with their wants.</p>\r\n<p>Our efforts were rewarded as we witnessed the excitement of the management team at the potential provided by adopting the recommended solutions. We outlined a three-step process for implementation with short-term, medium-term, and long-term objectives. Over the coming months we will continue working closely with the ServUsTECH team to ensure appropriate implementation and a successful outcome.</p>\r\n<p>Leaving Romania has proved bittersweet. Over the past five weeks we built many close friendships with the ServUsTECH team – friendships we were reluctant to step away from. In a show of adoption of us as part of their team, the ServUsTECH team threw a party for us in the office Thursday night where we got to share stories of our time together, karaoke, and laugh into the night. This was an event that will not be forgotten anytime soon by the people who were in attendance.</p>\r\n<p>It is a unique privilege to have the opportunity to experience another person’s culture. Living in Romania taught us valuable lessons through the stories of those we met along the way. I recently read an article about growing your global mindset and it discussed the importance of adjusting to different environments and cultures internationally. If this experience was indicative of what it means to have a global mindset, I hope this was a start to my beautiful, worldwide journey.</p>"
