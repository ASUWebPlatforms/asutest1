After a stint as director of marketing for Pet Food warehouse (before it became PetsMart), Siner teamed with her sister, Jennifer, to open a small Phoenix store selling consigned clothing. Today, 20 years later, the sisters control a 10-store empire that includes four&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.mysisterscloset.com/\">My Sister’s Closets</a>&nbsp;and four&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.mysistersattic.com/shop/\">My Sister’s Attic</a>&nbsp;locations offering home furnishings, and a pair of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.shopwellsuited.com/shop/\">Well Suited Men’s Resale</a>stores.</p>\r\n<p>For the second time in as many years, Ann opened one of her Closets to Project Artemis fellows. On May 3, 2011, the nine Pakistani businesswomen who came to Thunderbird for entrepreneurship training under the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www2.goldmansachs.com/citizenship/10000women/index.html\">Goldman Sachs<em>10,000 Women</em></a>&nbsp;program, met with Siner at her My Sister’s Closet location in Scottsdale, Arizona.</p>\r\n<p>Siner shared startup secrets and business advice with the group and then escorted them across the shopping center to one of her My Sister’s Attic locations. The Pakistani participants asked lots of questions, shared their own experiences, and generally soaked up the opportunity to observe a U.S. retail outlet in action.</p>\r\n<p>Siner also took time to share her thoughts about the group and the program, which is modeled on Thunderbird’s successful&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thunderbird.edu/about_thunderbird/thunderbird_good/afghanistan/index.htm\">Project Artemis Afghanistan</a>&nbsp;program, which launched in 2005 and has trained more than 60 women entrepreneurs from that country.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q. What impressed you most about the Project Artemis fellows?<br>A.</strong>&nbsp;I was most impressed by the Artemis ladies in the obstacles they have overcome in order to be in business and stay in business in their country. Hearing their stories truly makes me appreciate the good ole' USA! I was also impressed by their poise and eagerness to learn. Their questions were well thought out and sincere. It was obvious they want to get all the knowledge they can in the next 3 weeks.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q. What do you believe is the most important lesson you can share with these businesswomen?<br>A.&nbsp;</strong>Overnight success doesn’t happen. It usually takes 10-15 years to build a solid, well-respected business, so be patient and don’t give up. Stay in the fight if you believe in what you are doing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q. How can you relate to the challenges of these women in their native Pakistan?<br>A.</strong>&nbsp;I can relate to the Pakistani women in several ways. First we all love fashion and saving money. It doesn't matter where you live, as a woman, you want to be stylish without breaking the bank. As an entrepreneur, I can relate in that we all have to overcome obstacles. The Pakistani ladies have bigger obstacles without a doubt! We all have faced rejection in our businesses or careers and to share that is supportive.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q. What lessons learned at Thunderbird were you able to apply as you opened and grew your business?<br>A.</strong>&nbsp;At Thunderbird, the focus was often on team building and learning to work together. Many projects were done as a group, and I've applied that concept successfully throughout my 20 years at My Sister's Closet. My brief stint in law school focused on the individual and the unwritten code to get ahead any way you can. At T-bird, the focus is how to succeed in business working WITH people. Artemis epitomizes that concept as we are all sharing our knowledge.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q. Why do you believe a program such as Project Artemis, one that brings women entrepreneurs to the Valley to learn best practices, is important?<br>A.</strong>&nbsp;Project Artemis is critical to not only the women that come here to learn, but it is critical for those of us in the U.S. to learn from these women. The timing of this group is interesting in that it would be so easy to be angry at Pakistan for allowing bin Laden to hide there, but when we meet like-minded women trying to succeed in business, we realize we are all one world and truly need to work together. When we first opened My Sister's Closet, we talked to other resale store owners both in Phoenix and in other cities. The knowledge and experiences they shared with us was invaluable in getting our business started. It might be trite to say \"why reinvent the wheel?\" but when it comes to business, any knowledge shared can save you money, time and angst!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q. How is Thunderbird position differently from others to offer such a learning opportunity?<br>A.</strong>&nbsp;Thunderbird is a unique school and environment. I'm sure other schools could offer programs like Artemis, but the T-bird connection is vast and extremely strong. I've learned that wherever I go, if you say you are a T-bird, many, many doors open! I hope the Artemis ladies can use this network as well.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q. Where are you from originally, and what was your path to Thunderbird?<br>A.</strong>&nbsp;I grew up in Colorado and went to undergraduate school at Colorado College (and loved the block plan). I started in law school and quickly realized it wasn't right for where I wanted to go in life. A little research led me to Thunderbird and Phoenix. An internship through T-bird before I graduated in May 1985 resulted in a job in Phoenix and I've been here ever since.</p>"
