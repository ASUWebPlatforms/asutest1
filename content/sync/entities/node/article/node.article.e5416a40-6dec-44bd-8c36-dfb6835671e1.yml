But for working class families, the Amazon jobs were a reason to celebrate. The wages, starting at about $14 per hour or $30,000 per year before stock options and bonuses, are the best starting salaries of their kind, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/?post_type=post&amp;p=752102\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/?post_type=post&amp;p=752102\">Digital Commerce</a>, “and significantly exceed federal and state minimums.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"1*wrl9xzx-WJbnOYwAub9tFA.jpeg\" data-width=\"1024\" data-height=\"683\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*wrl9xzx-WJbnOYwAub9tFA.jpeg\" data-scroll=\"native\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*wrl9xzx-WJbnOYwAub9tFA.jpeg\" class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*wrl9xzx-WJbnOYwAub9tFA.jpeg\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4>Amazon warehouse employee (photo: Geoff Robinson)</h4>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The medical benefits can have a life changing effect, and unlike more short-term conscious employers or labor unions,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://realestate.cleveland.com/realestate-news/2017/08/amazon_commits_to_north_randal.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"http://realestate.cleveland.com/realestate-news/2017/08/amazon_commits_to_north_randal.html\">Amazon’s package</a>&nbsp;begins day one: Employees who work more than 20 hours receive life and disability insurance, dental and vision insurance with premiums paid in full and partial funding of medical insurance, as well as a 401(k) plan, paid time off and employee discounts.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To help employees develop the skills for a digital future, Amazon grants one of the most generous tuition reimbursement packages in the United States, covering 95 percent of the costs. Nicole Smith, chief economist at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cew.georgetown.edu/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://cew.georgetown.edu/\">Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce</a>, commented that Amazon’s education-related benefits are unique for people with only a high school education, where the job market has crashed.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Amazon.jobs</h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">At Amazon’s 100 fulfillment centers across the country, in one month alone in 2017 alone, the company&nbsp;<a href=\"https://qz.com/1039169/amazon-is-looking-to-hire-50000-people-in-one-day/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://qz.com/1039169/amazon-is-looking-to-hire-50000-people-in-one-day/\">hired 50,000</a>&nbsp;workers. But until Amazon showed up, these places were like a mining town without any gold. No one else is offering that scale of opportunity, not big labor, government, and for that matter not Facebook and not Google. Only Amazon. To paraphrase Winston Churchill, small-town America is saying, “give us the jobs, we already have the tools.”</p>\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"1*4YzQcxZ7zyO1I4olpYsQWg.png\" data-width=\"1698\" data-height=\"1742\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*4YzQcxZ7zyO1I4olpYsQWg.png\" data-scroll=\"native\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*4YzQcxZ7zyO1I4olpYsQWg.png\" class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*4YzQcxZ7zyO1I4olpYsQWg.png\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">Crates of&nbsp;Wrath</h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">The thunderous cheering from places like North Randall may be why a company as astute as Amazon was taken by surprise. A Cleveland based labor activist, PolicyMatters Ohio, sent out a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.policymattersohio.org/press-room/2018/01/05/more-ohio-amazon-workers-relying-on-food-aid\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://www.policymattersohio.org/press-room/2018/01/05/more-ohio-amazon-workers-relying-on-food-aid\">press release</a>&nbsp;alleging the company underpaid its warehouse workers to the point they had to rely on food assistance. The intent was to embarrass Amazon not because it employs people who move packages but because they are non-union.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The press release noted: “more than 700 Amazon workers received (food) benefits…or more than one in every 10 of those Ohioans employed by the company.” Then the tearjerker, “It is troubling that so many of those who qualify are working and still don’t make enough to get by.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It sent the media into a frenzy, but unfortunately, they forgot to check the facts<em>.&nbsp;</em>CNN to Salon.com, Slate, and Huffington Post, and others echoed a populist rant, “<a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/01/09/jeff-bezos-deemed-richest-man-in-world-while-amazon-warehouse-workers-suffer-grueling-conditions/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/01/09/jeff-bezos-deemed-richest-man-in-world-while-amazon-warehouse-workers-suffer-grueling-conditions/\"><em>Jeff Bezos deemed richest man in the world while Amazon warehouse workers suffer grueling conditions</em></a>.” Money worshippers like CNBC and The Street made it about employee fairness:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/story/14312539/1/amazon-warehouse-employees-discuss-grueling-work.html\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/story/14312539/1/amazon-warehouse-employees-discuss-grueling-work.html\"><em>Amazon Warehouse Employees’ to Jeff Bezos — We Are Not Robots</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em>Although the whole story was a red herring, journalists ate it up because Jeff Bezos in the same headline as food stamps was delicious schadenfreude.</p>\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"1*wQyf1uAH5GYNPDPJxWwlLw.jpeg\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"800\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*wQyf1uAH5GYNPDPJxWwlLw.jpeg\" data-scroll=\"native\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*wQyf1uAH5GYNPDPJxWwlLw.jpeg\" class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*wQyf1uAH5GYNPDPJxWwlLw.jpeg\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4>Workers striking outside Amazon (photo Omaha World-Herald)</h4>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">Kafkaesque</h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">More to the point, PolicyMatters Ohio claims were based on statistical sleight of hand, the skill a con artist uses to fool a ‘mark.’ In this case, the mark was the media.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For instance, the difference between part-time and full-time worker’s wages were intentionally blurred. In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benefits.gov/benefits/benefit-details/1588\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://www.benefits.gov/benefits/benefit-details/1588\">Ohio</a>, in order to qualify for food assistance, income for a family of two must fall below $20,826. Amazon confirmed its warehouse salaries with fact checker&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/amazon-employees-food-stamps/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://www.snopes.com/amazon-employees-food-stamps/\">Snopes.com</a>&nbsp;are in the range of $15 per hour or $31,000 per year, before stock and performance based bonuses.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The labor activist implied 700 Amazon employees were on food stamps because someone in the household also received assistance. That was like inferring from a list of employees with children that the company employs child labor.</p>\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"1*a8-nnS9w2uy1H_CTOraSLQ.jpeg\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"533\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*a8-nnS9w2uy1H_CTOraSLQ.jpeg\" data-scroll=\"native\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*a8-nnS9w2uy1H_CTOraSLQ.jpeg\" class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*a8-nnS9w2uy1H_CTOraSLQ.jpeg\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4>The famed medical institute, The Cleveland Clinic, also has people on food&nbsp;stamps</h4>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">The third flaw was leaving a false impression that Amazon knew which employees were on assistance. Privacy laws prevented Amazon from finding out who those employees are, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-employees-on-food-stamps-in-ohio-2018-1\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-employees-on-food-stamps-in-ohio-2018-1\">Business Insider</a>&nbsp;confirms the law of large numbers is the culprit, not Amazon: “Other large employers in the state, like Walmart, Kroger, Home Depot, the Cleveland Clinic, and Target also have employees that draw benefits.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The fourth oversight was to conceal the ways someone can qualify for food assistance, leading readers to believe the wage level is the problem. Compassionate social programs like Ohio’s offer assistance for a number of reasons, for instance, if a family member is elderly or disabled. That is why, according to Snopes, “This circumstance might well qualify someone for food stamps even if their hourly wage at Amazon were otherwise not too bad.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Kafkaesque, indeed.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Get The&nbsp;Facts</h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">There are two inviolable rules of good journalism, and the first is to get the facts before you form an opinion.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In the big data, crowdsourced world, checking an employer’s reputation is easy.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/about/index_input.htm\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/about/index_input.htm\">Glassdoor</a>, the Yelp of employee review sites, reveals how actual employees feel about their company’s wages and benefits. It can also identify who is the labor advocate and who is the publicity hypocrite.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">An employee of PolicyMatters Ohio posted a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Policy-Matters-Ohio-Reviews-E265863.htm\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Policy-Matters-Ohio-Reviews-E265863.htm\">review</a>&nbsp;complaining that as a research intern they weren’t paid any salary, which is ironic given the focus of the research was on blue collar wages. It is also the case that, according to expert&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.g-s-law.com/blog/unpaid-internships-in-ohio\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://www.g-s-law.com/blog/unpaid-internships-in-ohio\">Alex Granovsky</a>, “unpaid internships are nearly always a violation of<span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"></span>Ohio and Federal law under<span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">&nbsp;</span>the Fair Labor Standards Act:”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\">\r\n<div class=\"section-content\">\r\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\r\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"1*8y7uEqI4llB3mPOGdww6_A.png\" data-width=\"1324\" data-height=\"810\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*8y7uEqI4llB3mPOGdww6_A.png\" data-scroll=\"native\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*8y7uEqI4llB3mPOGdww6_A.png\" class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*8y7uEqI4llB3mPOGdww6_A.png\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">Arianna Gets All The&nbsp;Scratch</h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">That second rule of journalism is follow the money. This line of inquiry had a shocking revelation: people aiming for a media career might be better off taking a job at an Amazon warehouse. Glassdoor was quite revealing on the matter of pay and worker conditions at media companies as well as Amazon warehouses:</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/TheStreet-Salaries-E7494.htm\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/TheStreet-Salaries-E7494.htm\">The Street</a>, the hourly rate is&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">$10.12</span>, and may explain why employees at “booyah” Jim Cramer’s stock tip website disparage the atmosphere: “People sit and stare at their computers. I go home and am in a depressed mood because I didn’t speak for 8 hours.” *</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">At Verizon-owned but uber liberal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Huffington-Post-Salaries-E230057.htm\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Huffington-Post-Salaries-E230057.htm\">Huffington Post</a><span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">,</span>&nbsp;the tagline is ‘<em>know what’s real</em>,’ so they will applaud our telling you the hourly rate, at&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">$11.87,</span>&nbsp;may be why employees say “40% of the staff was drunk. They fire everyone and hire back at half the rate. Work-life balance is off. Arianna gets all the scratch.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Compare those to an Ohio&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/Amazon-Amazon-Warehouse-Worker-Ohio-Hourly-Pay-EJI_IE6036.0,6_KO7,30_IL.31,35_IS2235.htm\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Hourly-Pay/Amazon-Amazon-Warehouse-Worker-Ohio-Hourly-Pay-EJI_IE6036.0,6_KO7,30_IL.31,35_IS2235.htm\">Amazon warehouse worker</a>&nbsp;where the hourly rate is&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">$14</span>&nbsp;an hour, and as an employees notes, “Benefits from day one. I only pay $16 for medical dental and vision. The trainer I had was awesome and the atmosphere is awesome. Right off the bat you get 10 hours personal time.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This suggests the media is dreadfully elitist, if not downright hypocritical, towards the blue collar world. Journalists see a high school educated warehouse worker making $12 an hour, they call it slave wages. But if they hire an Ivy League graduate as a reporter at $25,000 a year, which also computes to $12 per hour, somehow that’s following your passion.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">The Visionary</h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">In 2018, the most important question to ask about Amazon is not its stock price or how rich is Jeff Bezos. They key metric is how many people’s lives are enriched by the opportunity of working across a wide variety of disciplines, locations, and sectors of the digital economy?</p>\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"1*JhRpT4T-JE2e1piOUPX1rw.jpeg\" data-width=\"1200\" data-height=\"800\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*JhRpT4T-JE2e1piOUPX1rw.jpeg\" data-scroll=\"native\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*JhRpT4T-JE2e1piOUPX1rw.jpeg\" class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*JhRpT4T-JE2e1piOUPX1rw.jpeg\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">As Bezos might say, the answer to that question begins with a number:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/234488/number-of-amazon-employees/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/234488/number-of-amazon-employees/\">566,000</a>. That is the number of people employed by the company today, making Amazon the second largest employer in the United States, more than the unionized labor forces of the U.S. Postal Service at 508,000 and far more than General Motors’ 209,000. Facebook’s 25,000 employees are a small gathering by comparison.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">While Bezos moves the company forward through a combination of vision, skill, and high ideals, and with unflagging energy and administrative brilliance, he knows his employees are his most valuable asset. As every equity analyst pleads to change his long term ways, Bezos snubs Wall Street by overinvesting in people and in the communities where he drops anchor.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Progressive leaders have publicly praised the company for these reasons. If the media and big labor can get over their parochial hysteria, even they will admit there is something for everyone to love about Amazon.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"section-content\">\r\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing\">*(Disclosure: I served as a board director of The Street from 2009–2010).</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"1*8y7uEqI4llB3mPOGdww6_A.png\" data-width=\"1324\" data-height=\"810\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*8y7uEqI4llB3mPOGdww6_A.png\" data-scroll=\"native\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<h4>Author’s Bio</h4>\r\n<p>Jeff Cunningham is an advocate for enlightened global leadership, which he calls the most valuable natural resource in the world.</p>\r\n<p>He is a Professor at ASU’s Thunderbird School of Global Management and was the former publisher of Forbes Magazine, startup founder, digital content CEO, and ran an internet venture capital fund.</p>\r\n<p>He travels the globe in search of iconic leaders.
