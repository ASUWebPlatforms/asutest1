    value: "<p>My job in Afghanistan requires me to travel.&nbsp; I get to meet, see and attend a good number of meetings in different provinces.&nbsp;&nbsp; While in Bamyan Province, I had the opportunity to meet the new Director of Women Affairs,&nbsp;<strong>Fatima Kazimi</strong>.&nbsp; The day prior we were downtown Bamyan City with USAID Rep. MJ, and stopped in to see her shop.&nbsp; The shelves were fully stocked and her husband was behind the counter.&nbsp; At that time, I did not know Fatima was a former T-Bird Grad (Project Artemis, Afghanistan).</p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><em>Fatima Kazimi, Project Artemis Graduate 2006, Successful Business Owner , A graduate of Bamyan University 2008, and the new Director of Women Affairs for Bamyan Province.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p>The next day, I was scheduled to meet the new DOWA (Director of Women Affairs) to discuss a few programs and her “way ahead” strategy for Bamyan Women.&nbsp; When I mentioned Project Artemis, Fatima proudly informed me that she was a 2006 graduate.&nbsp; We talked for awhile about building a list of potential Artemis candidates, establishing a Woman’s Business Association and suggested that she and other Artemis grads like Zainab (2010 graduate and Teresa’s mentee) become mentors themselves.&nbsp; They would be a great asset in assisting/coaching new business women prior to their arrival in Phoenix and providing mentoring for those who unfortunately do not get accepted.</p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><em>Fatima’s office.&nbsp; The room was filled with flowers.&nbsp; She recently applied and was accepted as the new Director of Women Affairs (DOWA) for Bamyan Province.</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>MJ is currently the USAID Rep in the area.&nbsp; We are lucky to have her because Gender and Private Sector Development are her main priorities.&nbsp; She has been a strong supporter of Thunderbird’s efforts to educate Afghan businesswomen, helping to identify the very best applicants from the Bamyan community, and assisting them through the application and visa processes.&nbsp; MJ meets with Fatima at least once per week - mentoring continues.</p>\r\n<p>Fatima is a shining example of what can be accomplished when given encouragement and mentorship.</p>\r\n<p>KUDOS to PROJECT ARTEMIS!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><em>This is Fatima’s building.&nbsp; Her new office space will be ready soon.&nbsp; She was on her way out to meet with the Governor.</em></p>"
