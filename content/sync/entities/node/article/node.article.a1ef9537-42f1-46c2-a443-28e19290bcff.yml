We understand the military and the challenges of transitioning to civilian life. Guided by the knowledge that veterans need a unique academic and social quality contact, Thunderbird's Senior Director of Student Experience &amp; Affairs Guy Groff is the primary point of contact for any military- or veteran-related-issues, concerns, or questions students at Thunderbird may have.</p>\r\n<p>Guy Groff is a retired Marine who served 22 years. When he retired, he was running a military transition center in Japan, helping servicemen to make the transition to the civilian world. With a master's degree in counseling, he works for the <a href=\"/node/574\">Thunderbird Career Management Center,</a> helping veterans connect with one another, training faculty and staff on challenges veterans face and offering to counsel current and new students.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, Groff is the faculty director assigned to an on-campus <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/students/campus-life/clubs-and-organizations\">student veterans club</a> that helps servicemembers feel more engaged in student life and career choices. His role and the role of the club is to help our veteran students make good decisions and have a support group to help them transition from military to the international business world.</p>\r\n<p>He shared some insights with us here:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q. What is your role as a Senior Director in the <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/students/career-services\">Career Center at Thunderbird</a>?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Guy:</strong> Basically, I am the orchestra leader. We manage all the development process, corporate connections, building the center. We work on what we call three pillars: the first one is career decisions, the second one is career preparation and the third is career performance. We have this foundation of connections to the whole process.&nbsp; </p>\r\n<p><strong>Q. What is the number one piece of advice you give to a student with a military background?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Guy:</strong> Evaluate your own personal value with a counselor. This is <span>part of the reason why I helped establish a veterans student club at</span>&nbsp;Thunderbird. But the first step is to figure out who you are, what value you bring and then look into what you want to do. We are here to offer resources to help you and support to drive your career forward. Also, take advantage of scholarships.&nbsp;Thunderbird offers a <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/yount\">military scholarship opportunity </a>in partnership with the Hinrich&nbsp;Foundation exclusively for military members.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q. What specific skills and learning outcomes from Thunderbird would you consider the most valuable for veteran students?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Guy:</strong> This is a school of global leadership. You are going to learn how business works globally and will understand marketing, finance and human resources from an international perspective. Plus, you will develop your communication skills--particularly cross-cultural and global communication--so you can learn how to lead in the global environment in which we all live right now. Thunderbird creates global leaders who understand business and manage business and who lead businesses going forward in global settings. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Q. What is the employment rate for military/veteran students at Thunderbird?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Guy:</strong> For veterans it is 100%. Everybody gets a job, though the time frames vary. The sooner you make a decision about where you want to take your career, the easier it is to prepare and make a connection.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q. Who are the top employers hiring military/veteran students from Thunderbird?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Guy:</strong> This is a tough one. There are a lot of companies that want to hire veterans. It’s hard to target. If you look online there are a lot of companies that are looking for veterans from Starbucks to IBM, to Microsoft, to Intel, and almost every major bank: Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo. These organizations basically have a whole recruiting section just for veterans. Here in town, Go Daddy. I know the veteran recruiter and he is a retired Navy chief.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Q. How can students be part of the Veteran’s Club at Thunderbird?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Guy: I am the faculty director assigned to the Veteran’s Club and I work directly with the student veterans in the club. Students who want to be part of the club can <a href=\"mailto:guy.groff@thunderbird.asu.edu\" target=\"_blank\">reach out to me</a> and I will put them in contact with the club president. And the connections made in this club don't end when the students leave; they are going to continue to stay connected as veteran alumni to come back and help future veteran students!</p>\r\n<p>If you are a military/veteran student and need additional information please contact&nbsp;Guy Groff directly.<br><a href=\"mailto:guy.groff@thunderbird.asu.edu\" target=\"_blank\"><span class=\"btn btn-gold\">Contact Guy!</span></a></p>"
