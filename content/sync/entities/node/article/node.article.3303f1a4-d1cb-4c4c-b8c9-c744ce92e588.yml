Looking for a graduate school to extend his skill set, Matthew found Thunderbird''s global footprint very appealing. But the reason he ultimately chose the MGM program was the people. “This group of like-minded people took me in and showed me that there are others who have a global mindset when it comes to problem solving,” Matthew said. “On top of that, the future-oriented opportunities and classes offered make Thunderbird the perfect laboratory to test my newly gained skills before leaving to tackle real-world issues.”</p><p>Before coming to Thunderbird, Matthew attended the University of Oregon where he graduated with a BS in Public Relations. He spent time working in Israel as a communications coordinator at the China Israel Exchange, coordinating connections between Israeli start-ups and Chinese financiers. In Guatemala, Matthew volunteered at Long Way Home, where he assisted with a water conservation project for the community.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in Phoenix for the past two years, Matthew has worked as VP of Business Development at Truce LLC, a company that makes high-quality green cleaning products. He lives and works part-time at Moishe House, where in exchange for part of their rent, he and his roommates organize eight events each month for the Jewish community in Phoenix.&nbsp;</p><p>When he finishes his MGM, Matthew is excited to explore different career paths. “I love working with energetic founders who are passionate about their companies,” he said. “After school, I plan to pursue opportunities to consult for companies that are positively impacting our world.”&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;<i>“This group of like-minded people took me in and showed me that there are others who have a global mindset when it comes to problem solving.” ~T-bird Matthew Witenstein &nbsp;&nbsp;</i><a href="https://ctt.ec/XfYT3">Click to Tweet&nbsp;</a><a href="applewebdata://9826469B-FF50-4567-9794-D3B9E3F4BFFB#_msocom_4" id="_anchor_4" name="_msoanchor_4"></a></p></blockquote><h4>Dr. Mahmoud Zarati</h4><p>For Mahmoud, Thunderbird is more than just a school. “It is a place where dreams meet creativity and connections to turn into a great reality,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;“I chose Thunderbird because of its top-notch professors, amazing students, awesome staff, and its global ranking.”</p><p>Mahmoud is originally from Tunisia, giving him a unique global perspective. He holds several degrees, including a Master’s in Business Management from South Mediterranean University and a Doctor of Pharmacy from Faculté De Pharmacie de Monastir.&nbsp;</p><p>Mahmoud has worked with a number of global organizations, including Merck and Sanofi Tunisia. He said his experience in North African markets and his expertise in pharmacy give him a unique skill set that he can share with his fellow cohort.

She chose to come to Thunderbird herself “because of the diversity of its students, the world-class faculty and the strong alumni network,” she said. “Thunderbird provides me with the tools necessary to develop as a global leader. But above all, T-birds are misfits, global citizens, and eager world travelers. Being part of Thunderbird means having friends and a home everywhere in the world.”&nbsp;</p><p>Ana Paula is currently pursuing a dual major at ASU and Thunderbird in Economics and Global Management with a minor in Asian Languages focusing on Mandarin. Her learning goal is to continue developing intercultural empathy while honing her skills as a leader.</p><p>In 2017, Ana Paula co-founded Tantay Yanasu NGO.&nbsp;&nbsp;The organization was initially focused on temporary disaster relief, helping the victims of&nbsp;<i>El Niño Costero,</i>&nbsp;the severe storms that flooded much of western and central South America. However, after witnessing the reality of extreme and extensive multi-generational poverty, her team decided unanimously to formalize the organization as a way of committing to create prosperity and positive change in Peru. In just three years, Tantay Yanasu NGO has helped 3,382 people in 14 shelters, one prison, six educational institutions, and three medical centers. Its project areas include women empowerment, entrepreneurial training, local government reform, social reinsertion and eradication of extreme poverty.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;<i>“Thunderbird provides me with the tools necessary to develop as a global leader.” ~ T-bird Ana Paula Chavarry</i>&nbsp;<a href="https://ctt.ec/eDzSA">Click to Tweet</a><a href="applewebdata://9826469B-FF50-4567-9794-D3B9E3F4BFFB#_msocom_9" id="_anchor_9" name="_msoanchor_9"></a></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;With experiences ranging from business to pharmaceuticals to law, these MGM students have inspiring visions for the future.
