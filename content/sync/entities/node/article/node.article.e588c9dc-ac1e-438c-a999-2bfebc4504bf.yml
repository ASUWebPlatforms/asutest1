Here they are:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">I’m very self-motivated. How will you measure my success in this position after one full year?</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">The first 30 days are very important for me to meet as many team members as possible. How will you recommend I do that?</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">What are the Top 3 skills or experiences you are looking for that may not be mentioned in the job description?</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Of all of the people who have worked for you, what are the characteristics of those who have stood out as great performers?</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">I have to admit I’m a perfectionist in some areas. What are the aspects of this position that absolutely require precision and attention to detail?</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Of all of the criteria you have outlined for this position, what are the Top 3 in stack rank order?</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">The position we are discussing is something I am very excited about. Can you give me feedback on how I am meeting your qualifications and if I will proceed to the next level of the hiring process? (This is called “going for the close”</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">or “asking for the order”</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">in sales.)</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">As an experienced hiring manager and interviewer, I am impressed when a candidate brings out a piece of paper with their questions written out. Obviously, they are prepared, thoughtful and thorough. It’s even better when they write down the answers under each question!</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Now that’s the type of employee I need on my team. What a great example showing how that person will prepare for an important meeting.</span></p>"
