In 2013, the city of Glendale adopted an Arts &amp; Cultural plan. This plan is a comprehensive vision of arts and culture that will be implemented over the next 5 years.

The school became a landmark for the city of Glendale when Thunderbird transitioned into the world's first-ever higher education institution focused exclusively on international business, setting the standard for global management education worldwide until this day.</p>\r\n<h3>Culture Celebrated on Campus</h3>\r\n<p>In an effort to bring the community to our campus, every year Thunderbird hosts the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://opendoor.asu.edu/thunderbird\">\"Night of the Open Door\"</a>, a family-friendly event that showcases everything that makes Thunderbird unique. Visitors have the opportunity to participate in interactive activities and talk to students, faculty, and staff. It's a truly global experience with activities for children of all ages include cooking demonstrations, flag making,&nbsp;futbol&nbsp;shootout, and other educational and cultural experiences. It is a day designed to share Thunderbird with the local community and for them to personally discover what makes Thunderbird so special.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>At every commencement, graduates representing each of the countries in the graduating class carry the flags of their homeland or the country of their family’s origin. 2017 marked the 40th anniversary of the&nbsp;<a href=\"/node/2538\">Thunderbird flag tradition</a>. The Thunderbird Parade of Flags is one of the moments that brings&nbsp;people together and makes us all proud to be part of such a welcome, diverse community.</p>\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"5779\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Thunderbird Flags\",\"height\":\"390\",\"width\":\"640\",\"style\":\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-video media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]</p>\r\n<p>When you come to Glendale to be part of Thunderbird, not only will you find a multicultural hub, but also a family. The Thunderbird family strongly&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #000000;\">believes&nbsp;</span><span>in bringing diverse people together for a greater understanding which creates global leaders who are equipped socially, emotionally and professionally to make a better world.</span></p>"
