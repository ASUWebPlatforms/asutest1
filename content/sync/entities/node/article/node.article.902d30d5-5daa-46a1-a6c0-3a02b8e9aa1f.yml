They explore the impact of several factors including:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>the reality of starting from a low productivity baseline,&nbsp;</li><li>migration of workers from rural regions,&nbsp;</li><li>growing government debt,&nbsp;</li><li>a crisis in corporate leadership&nbsp;</li></ul><p>They suggest that Chinese firms could become more competitive globally by changing in five important ways:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Show respect on the global stage and learn to soften its China-centric mindset</li><li>Promote inpatration (or bringing global leaders together)</li><li>Find a healthy balance in expatriation&nbsp;</li><li>Invest in leadership development&nbsp;</li><li>Innovate outside of China</li></ul><p>A partial trade agreement is scheduled to be signed in January and talks between the Washington and Beijing are expected to continue.

Chinese corporate leaders need to make some internal cultural shifts. They need to adjust how they see themselves in the world and how they interact with an international workforce and customer base.&nbsp;</p><p>Morrison and Black conclude that “absent a major pivot in thinking and approach, they will be unable to deliver the productivity gains needed to offset the consequences of the steepening decline in the country’s working age population. If the current leadership composition continues, we predict that like Japanese firms before them, Chinese companies will begin to slide off the Global 500.”</p>'

    summary: "Size matters in the global economy. And attention to the global health of China’s economy has much to do with how its vast size makes it a major driver of global growth.\r\nChina’s trading partners and global investors are closely watching the health of the world’s second-largest economy as the trade war with the United States fuels fears about a global recession. \r\nBusiness in China has been on the rise, but that climb is showing signs of slowing. And China’s leaders are beginning to contend with the country’s slowest pace of growth in nearly three decades. Economic reports at the end of 2019 reveal downbeat Chinese economic data pointing to weaker demand at home and abroad."
