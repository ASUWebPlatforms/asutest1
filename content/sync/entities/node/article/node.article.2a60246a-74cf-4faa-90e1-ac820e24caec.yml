So what are these skills, and where can you find them?</p>\r\n<p>If you think the answer is “an MBA program,” think again. For global business success, you are better served by a program that combines <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/knowledge-network/3-business-school-students-benefits-peer-learning-0\">peer-to-peer learning</a> and <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/knowledge-network/peer-learning-v-professor-knows-all\">professor-centered learning</a> to develop different but equally important skills.</p>\r\n<h3>Peers + Professors</h3>\r\n<p>Peer-to-peer learning empowers students to interact with each other and work together toward educational goals. It’s a proven effective way to learn real-world skills that are in high demand – skills like collaboration, critical thinking, and expanded global viewpoints.</p>\r\n<p>Here at Thunderbird, peer learning is a fundamental part of the experience – it’s known as the “collaborate to graduate” model.</p>\r\n<p>One recent graduate, Juan Carlos Quiroga of Bolivia, says his classroom experiences with peers from around the world gave him the right mindset for success. “Of course it was competitive – that’s healthy,” he says. “But people helped and collaborated in every aspect, so all of us grew as a ‘we.’ ”</p>\r\n<p>Professor-centered learning, meanwhile, is essential for delivering factual information in a controlled environment. And the expert professors at Thunderbird amplify the business facts and theories they teach by sharing their hard-earned experiences with students.</p>\r\n<h3>Preparation</h3>\r\n<p>Combining both types of learning is the best preparation for the real world of business. And that’s why demand is growing for <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/knowledge-network/mba-alternatives-which-graduate-degree-best-you\">specialized master’s degrees</a>, says Suzanne Sanchez, a recruiter at Thunderbird School of Global Management.</p>\r\n<p>“Now, employers are less interested in a particular degree and more interested in a particular skill set,” she says. “Specialized master’s programs are designed to develop both the broad management skills as well as the specific skills that reflect a person’s ability to lead a team of data scientists or negotiate deals in a foreign country, for example.”</p>\r\n<p>That’s where Thunderbird comes in. We offer specialized master’s degree programs that deliver the skills and learning experiences Sanchez describes. Read on to see how.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>“Employers are less interested in a particular degree and more interested in a particular skill set.” <i>– <a href=\"https://ctt.ec/gXfW4\">Click to tweet</a></i><i><br></i></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/degrees/graduate/master-global-management\">Master of Global Management (MGM)</a></h3>\r\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Build your adaptability, resilience, problem solving, and cross-cultural communications.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Peer learning:</strong> You and your high-caliber peers will work together and learn how to adapt to ever-changing global business environments and to manage across diverse cultures and uncertain scenarios.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Professor-to-student learning:</strong> Your professors will provide specialized training in every business discipline from an international perspective and will share their firsthand experiences from working and living around the globe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>“Broaden your global mindset as well as your global leadership network.” <i>– <a href=\"https://ctt.ec/6DMwd\">Click to tweet</a></i><i><a href=\"#_msocom_2\" id=\"_anchor_2\" name=\"_msoanchor_2\"></a><br></i></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h3><a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/degrees/graduate/executive-programs-arizona-cohort\">Executive Master of Global Management (Executive MGM)</a></h3>\r\n<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Broaden your global mindset as well as your global leadership network.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Peer learning:</strong> The program is delivered in a <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/degrees/graduate/executive-programs-arizona-cohort\">cohort model</a> in which you and your peers bring your real-world professional scenarios into the classroom and work together.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Professor-to-student learning:</strong> Your professors will take you on global field seminars in a focused region of the world, where you will participate in meetings with businesses, governments, and cultural leaders.
