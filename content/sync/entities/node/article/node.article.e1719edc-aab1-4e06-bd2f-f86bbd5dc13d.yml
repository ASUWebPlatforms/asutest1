his fingerprints, influence, and energy are all over everything. &nbsp;He has introduced us around KUSOM and will be teeing us up to the other key partners involved with the incubator. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://winrockvolunteers.wordpress.com/2014/06/06/a-great-opportunity-to-help-a-developing-country/\">Vrigu Duwadi</a>&nbsp;and Saluna Pokhrel are our tireless backers at Winrock. &nbsp;Their support and insight have been very valuable. &nbsp;Additionally, we’ve had the opportunity to meet with a variety of local entrepreneurs, working in agri-tourism, hotel management, tech, shoe vending, Tibetan silk trading, day care centers, artisanal goods, and restaurants. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-PfddZebO0yE/VNg6YPVZkdI/AAAAAAAADJc/of0HEJjsDXU/w1063-h709-no/DSC_1195.JPG\" width=\"350\" height=\"233\" hspace=\"10\" vspace=\"10\">From meetings with high-level officials and professors to conversations with business owners in tucked-away markets, it has been an amazing series of learning experiences. &nbsp;We believe that the best routes to understanding Nepal and its entrepreneurial environment involve old-fashioned listening and hitting the pavement. &nbsp;So, we’ve done a lot of both, and it has been rewarding and fun. &nbsp;With each interview, conversation, and hour spent soaking up the scene, our knowledge and appreciation have grown. &nbsp;These efforts will continue in the coming weeks until we have enough perspective to write a dynamic Operations Manual for the KUSOM business incubator and a comprehensive Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Assessment of Nepal for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/agriculture-and-food-security/supporting-agricultural-capacity-development/john-ogonowski\">Farmer-to-Farmer/USAID</a>. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Team KUSOM</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/profile/public-profile-settings?trk=prof-edit-edit-public_profile\">Travis Richardson</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=15068637&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=aPPN&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah2&amp;trkInfo=tarId%3A1423501033325%2Ctas%3Amatthew%20%2Cidx%3A1-2-2\">Matt McConaty</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=66540526&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=CuDi&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah2&amp;trkInfo=tarId%3A1423501066290%2Ctas%3Avarun%20%2Cidx%3A1-3-3\">Varun Vijay</a></p>"
