Following their 5-minute pitch, Paul and Nicholas, founders of&nbsp;Kalitunsi&nbsp;Tree Fund, were ready to answer any questions that came their way during the 8-minute Q&amp;A. And they won first place.</p><p>The competition’s top three finalists were:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>First Place&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Kalitunsi Tree Fund</p><p>Founders: Paul Gasaatura, MGM; and Nicholas&nbsp;Vandam, MGM</p><p><strong>Second Place</strong></p><p>SampleSpace<a href="applewebdata://5840FD6B-B051-4861-8C60-19E243AE1E53#_msocom_4" id="_anchor_4" name="_msoanchor_4"><br></a></p><p>Founders: Fred Zlaket, MGM; Tiong Poh Sheng; Vinu Raj Subramaniyan Radha, MGM&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Third Place</strong></p><p>Pauline Foundation, a nonprofit created to&nbsp;help empower at-risk youth in Uganda</p><p>Founder: Pauline Nalumansi,&nbsp;MA in Global Affairs and Management&nbsp;</p><h3>Strength from the Thunderbird Family&nbsp;</h3><p>Paul and Nicholas&nbsp;came away from the event with first place, $3,000 and&nbsp;lots of lessons picked up along the way as they prepared to share their business plans with the alumni judges. But the biggest lesson they learned was not one you often find in blog posts about meeting with venture capitalists (VCs).</p><p>A few days after the contest, after the dust had settled and Kalitunsi Tree Fund had won first place, Paul said: “It’s&nbsp;great to have the opportunity to work with others you are friends with and trust.

We are aiming to hit a triple bottom line by addressing environmental, social, and financial&nbsp;issues through growing forests in Uganda.&nbsp;Kalitunsi&nbsp;will do this by investing in the scaling of a pilot forest in Southwestern Uganda. Through investing in eucalyptus trees at scale, we can grow forests that will offset Co2 emissions, provide much-needed transmissions poles to spread electricity through eastern Africa, and through those two activities generate a strong ROI for investors. We believe that sustainability should be able to coexist&nbsp;with capitalism&nbsp;in Africa&nbsp;and aim to provide that synchrony through our forest investments.</p><p><strong>What problem&nbsp;is your project solving?&nbsp;</strong><br><br><strong>Paul Gasaatura</strong>:&nbsp;We are aligning sustainability with profitability. Hopefully, by proving out the model we inspire further investment in the region.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How has your time at Thunderbird helped define your project or support your goals? &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Paul Gasaatura</strong>:&nbsp;We spent the summer in Zambia interning for a private equity fund managed by a Thunderbird grad. During that time we spoke often of investment opportunities&nbsp;in the region. We are bringing together a common practice of farming&nbsp;eucalyptus&nbsp;forest with the idea of large corporations looking to offset Co2 emissions. We see this as a great opportunity to invest in Africa, provide a social benefit, and bring a return to investors in the hopes that they will continue to invest in the region.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What lessons would you like to share with other students?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Paul Gasaatura</strong>:&nbsp;In creating a pitch or an idea, think simple. How can you present an idea as simply as possible, while focused on the material that investors want to hear? Also, you don''t have to reinvent the wheel, just think on how to combine common things in a unique application. And lastly, leverage your strengths.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What will you and your team do with the cash winnings?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Paul Gasaatura</strong>:&nbsp;Invest in travel to Uganda, and look to begin to draft the legal framework in order to raise capital for the investment.</p><p><strong>Anything else you''d like to share about your project and the process of pitching it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Paul Gasaatura</strong>:&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;great to have the opportunity to work with others you are friends with and trust. Look for partnerships within those people.</p>'
