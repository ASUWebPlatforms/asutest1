We are all quickly recovering (read: sleeping), spending time with family, and enjoying the Arizona weather before we travel to Toledo, Ohio to give our final presentation.</p>\r\n<p>While we are adjusting quickly, here are a few things we've noticed that may sound familiar to those of you who've experienced reverse culture shock after being in Asia (and likely other developing countries).</p>\r\n<p>Here's how you know you just got back from Asia...</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>You keep getting in trouble for throwing toilet paper in the wastebasket.</li>\r\n<li>You find yourself wading through traffic and when you look back you're surprised to see your friends walking to a place on the street with yellow painted lines.</li>\r\n<li>When you go out, the smell of clean air—and absence of the smell of burning plastic—surprises you.</li>\r\n<li>At first the vast space is relaxing, but then you start to feel a bit lonely.</li>\r\n<li>The Caesar salad at Starbucks that used to look tiny now looks big. On the other hand, the high price tag makes you weep.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>When you get your wecome-home soy Americano (size medium because you really don't want too much) at the airport, you're&nbsp; sure they tripled the sizes while you were gone.</li>\r\n<li>You accidentally speak in special English at the grocery store checkout line—\"You have bag, plastic one?\"</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>We're glad to be home and miss our new home in southeast Asia. We can't wait to share our stories with each of you.</p>\r\n<p><em>Photo: \"I knew you had to be T-birds.\" We had an impromtu reunion with the two people on the right. The man, a T-bird alumn '10, noticed us around the hotel and said he instantly knew we were T-birds. \"Why else would such a random group of people be working together and talking about business investment in Myanmar?\" And to his point, it makes sense that he—an Indian who is working for a Korean oil and gas company in India is exploring business opportunities for the company in Myanmar and Thailand—is a T-bird.</em></p>"
