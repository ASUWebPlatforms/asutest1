No matter what comes your&nbsp;way, you and your employees are all you have.</p>\r\n<p>Some factors are beyond your control and can make the brass ring harder to grab. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sponsor-story/allstate/2017/04/26/small-business-owners-see-big-things-their-future/100901132/\">2017 Allstate/USA TODAY Small Business Barometer</a>, a study that combines federal data with a&nbsp;national survey of nearly 2,800 small-business owners, finds that the ease with which small&nbsp;business owners can get the commodities they need has gone down considerably since the&nbsp;2016 Barometer release. Meanwhile,&nbsp;unemployment continues to fall, which means more&nbsp;people are finding jobs — a good&nbsp;thing for the economy, but also a reason hiring good staff may&nbsp;be a challenge right now.</p>\r\n<p>Despite these headwinds, the nation’s small business owners are incredibly optimistic about the&nbsp;future, with a nationwide optimism score of 92 out of 100 on the Allstate/USA TODAY&nbsp;Barometer. Seattle is not far behind with a score of 88.</p>\r\n<p>So, what’s the secret&nbsp;to small business success? Seattle entrepreneur&nbsp;<a href=\"https://agents.allstate.com/paul-vogel-seattle-wa1/auto-insurance.html\">Paul Vogel</a>, 48, owner of an&nbsp;Allstate Insurance agency with offices in the University District, says small&nbsp;business owners improve their&nbsp;chances when they do a combination of these five things:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-font=\"Calibri, sans-serif\" data-listid=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><em><strong><span>Adapt to changing surroundings and demographics.</span></strong></em>&nbsp;Technology, neighborhoods and&nbsp;people’s tastes and needs all change. Your business should roll with the&nbsp;times, Vogel said.<br>With more high-rise buildings and condos going up in the neighborhoods he serves, meaning&nbsp;fewer cars, Vogel has adapted by marketing car insurance to the whole state.&nbsp;He also altered his product for apartment dwellers who do have cars, offering protection from&nbsp;incidents in parking garages and lots, rather than driveways.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true}\">&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-font=\"Calibri, sans-serif\" data-listid=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><em><strong><span>Get involved in the community.</span></strong></em>&nbsp;Among the best things you can do to gain the trust of your&nbsp;neighbors and visibility for your business are volunteering for local charities and contributing to&nbsp;local causes. Vogel coaches little league baseball, soccer and basketball, and he volunteers for&nbsp;the Boy Scouts and at local Rotary Clubs.&nbsp;“By being in the community, we really get to network with folks who could use our services,” he&nbsp;said.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true}\">&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-font=\"Calibri, sans-serif\" data-listid=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><em><strong><span>Hire the right people.</span>&nbsp;</strong></em>Whether it’s from friends, peers in your industry,&nbsp;or even the&nbsp;competition try getting referrals for new hires from people you know and trust, Vogel said.&nbsp;Send along the job description and tell them the type of person you’re looking for.&nbsp;Because these contacts know your business well and have likely vetted who they put&nbsp;you in&nbsp;contact with, a referral is far more likely to be someone who performs well and meshes with&nbsp;you, your employees and your customers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-font=\"Calibri, sans-serif\" data-listid=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"4\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><em><strong><span>Build relationships with customers.</span></strong></em>&nbsp;You’ll build loyalty and trust in your products or services.&nbsp;Vogel and his colleagues make phone calls to get to know their customers, while other small&nbsp;business owners&nbsp;he knows host customer appreciation events like barbecues and picnics&nbsp;or&nbsp;mingle with their customers at community events.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li data-leveltext=\"%1.\" data-font=\"Calibri, sans-serif\" data-listid=\"1\" data-aria-posinset=\"5\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><em><strong><span>Know the lay of the land.</span></strong></em>&nbsp;Stay up-to-date on city government programs and policies that&nbsp;affect your industry to ensure your business has everything it needs to succeed.

When Vogel turns in his tax forms each year,&nbsp;he makes a habit of checking in with city government to see if any insurance commission laws&nbsp;have changed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Vogel emphasizes that a successful small business is not just measured in company earnings,&nbsp;number of loyal customers, and name recognition. It’s also measured by the quality of life you&nbsp;and your employees enjoy.</p>\r\n<p>“When I started my career, I never thought I’d employ a half dozen people, like I do now,” Vogel&nbsp;said. “I want my company to succeed so I can give the people who work for me the ability to&nbsp;buy homes and have families and, in addition, have flexibility to enjoy time with their families —&nbsp;as though the people who work with me&nbsp;were&nbsp;also self-employed.”<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><em>Thunderbird School of Global Management Alumna Dana Manciagli '84 is the author of \"Cut the crap, Get a job\".

No matter what comes your way, you and your employees are all you have.\r\n\r\nSome factors are beyond your control and can make the brass ring harder to grab.
