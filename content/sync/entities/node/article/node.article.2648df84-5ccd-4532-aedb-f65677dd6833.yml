    value: "<p><em>Thunderbird School of Global Management alumna Dana Manciagli '84 is the author of \"Cut the crap, Get a job\" and the sole syndicated career columnist for the nationwide Business Journals with her 'Career Mojo' column. On her blog at <a href=\"http://danamanciagli.com/\">http://danamanciagli.com</a><a href=\"http://danamanciagli.com/\">/</a>, Dana answers her readers' questions about best practices for conducting an effective career search and interview process.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Question from reader:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">How do I answer this </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">interview question: </span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">“Tell me about yourself”? I struggle with that.</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Advice from Executive Job Coach Dana:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I think you are in good company. Most people approach this in one of the following ways:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Babble on and on, hoping to say one or two things that interest the interviewer(s).</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Do a résumé</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">walk-through. This is incorrect because the interviewer didn’t say, “Walk me through your resume.”</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">That’s a different question.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Stumble, hesitate and use too many filler words like “umm,”</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">as if it’s the first time the question has ever been asked.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">“Tell me about yourself”<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>is concurrently one of the most common interview prompts and one of the most poorly answered. This question, along with others such as, “What are your strengths,”<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>“what are your weaknesses,”<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>etc., should all be scripted well before the interview.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I purposely wrote two chapters on interviews in my book, specifically on all of the things you can do long before an interview (and NOT the night before!). In the book I recommend writing out all of the most commonly asked questions and your short answers to them.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">How short is short? Apply the “law of threes”: </span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Three bullet-point length phrases.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Say three short sentences, and then stop talking.&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">I repeat: three bullets, then shut up!</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">So let’s practice with, “tell me about yourself.”<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>Here’s a template for handling this one:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">First sentence: Your educational background</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Second sentence: Your work history</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Third sentence: Why you are making a career change and interviewing with them now.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Let’s put it into motion:&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I have a strong educational foundation with a bachelor<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\">s</span> of science in economics from the University of California at Santa Barbara and an MBA from UCLA.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">My sales and marketing work experience spans multiple industries. I spent seven years with IBM, 10 years with McKesson, and the most recently five years with Verizon.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">I am interested in expanding my career into international marketing and I am very interested in the global marketing role we are discussing today.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">After you make your three fabulous statements, stop talking, smile, and let the interviewer ask the next question.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Here are the two most common fears people have with this recommendation:</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">“I’m afraid I’ll sound scripted.”<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>First, you won’t. Second, that problem beats the opposite, which is sounding like you don’t know your own background.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">“It doesn’t feel like enough.”<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>Trust that the interviewer will ask you for more if they want more. Often, they are simply looking for your ability to distill a lot of information into a compact summary.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Question from Reader:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Help! I need your advice for an upcoming meeting to negotiate the salary I want when being hired.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Advice from Dana:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Most people do not do a good job negotiating a salary increase or compensation package for a variety of reasons. They “wing it,”<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>they don’t believe they can ask for a higher amount, or they are afraid of losing the offer.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">So here are my top four MUST-dos for you:</span></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Do your homework and over-prepare!&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Know your market value.</strong> <strong>How?</strong> Research sites like Glassdoor.com, network with peers in similar positions, and simply ask others.</span></li>\r\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Know your internal company value.&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\"><strong>How?</strong> Study your company’s career website, networking with others in similar positions, and learn on what salary increases are based. Understand your company’s metrics and how you are evaluated. Without that, you are dead.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Unfortunately too many women say, “I’ve done a good job this past year; therefore…”</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">even though their company may base increases on future potential or scope increase within a role.</span></li>\r\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Prepare your discussion and write out your presentation.&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Don’t “wing it”</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">or think that having a conversation is effective. It’s not.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Write out the flow of your discussion, limiting the topics to three items. For example, give the purpose of the discussion and your objective, present your supporting data and request the compensation package or salary increase.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Review your presentation with a friend or mentor to see if there are any gaps or missed opportunities.</span></li>\r\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Write your salary justification in a letter format.&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Distribute your justification letter and lead the discussion. Be clear and confident. Take notes, listen and respond in an impactful way.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">The hiring manager may need time to consider your proposal and get back to you. Don’t worry —</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">they will NOT rescind the offer. In fact, if you do this well, he or she may come back with some —</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">or even all —</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">of your requests!</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Question from Reader:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I’m considering relocating my family for a great career opportunity. Do you have any advice or recommendations for things to avoid?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong><span>Advice from Dana:</span></strong>&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Relocating —<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>domestically or internationally —<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>for a great career opportunity is a big step. I’ve made several moves with my husband and kids to take advantages of opportunities, too. I could go into each move separately, which would be a long story, so I’ll summarize my career relocation tips for going across the country or around the globe.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Things that went well:</span></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">The company that moved our family to Charlotte, N.C., and to Hong Kong had a lot of experience relocating people around the world and domestically. They developed a relocation program that really helped us understand what we could expect, secure help when we had questions, and ensure assistance was there on the “other side.”</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">My husband had moved a lot when he was a child and young adult, so he was very helpful in handling the logistics on both ends of the move. He took care of the children’s schools, the movers and home sales (when needed) so I could be successful diving into my job, traveling, and spending quality time with the kids when I was home.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Our attitudes: We looked forward to every move as an adventure. We were not high-maintenance, did not complain, and we taught our kids to be flexible, too. We researched the new places, explored and enjoyed the new environments, and more. As an example, people thought we were nuts to move to Rochester, N.Y., but we enjoyed it! We joined a small, affordable ski club where our kids could get lessons and I could sit by the fire with my laptop!</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Things we learned:</span></strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">I could not have done it alone (or if I had tried, I surely would have done it poorly). I would have had to take time off from my job or been stressed out juggling the logistics of a move and the pressures of a new position. Yes, relocations generally imply a new job either within your current company or with a new company.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">The importance of making friends. The onus is on the new (or visiting) family to make the effort to socialize, invite people to go out, or have houseguests. Remember, they have a social life already —</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">you need to put in the effort to introduce yourself and your family.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">In an international move, language barriers can be overcome! It takes work on the part of the new employee and his or her family. In Hong Kong, while our kids learned a small amount of Chinese in school, we chose not to invest the time in the local language. The locals spoke plenty of English, and we learned enough to get around.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Get the kids involved in some extracurricular activities like sports or music. Our kids played soccer, took karate classes, joined swimming teams, and more.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Question from Reader:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I am 25 and unemployed. I’m looking to head back to graduate school but would like to work during that time. I’ve never had a full time job in my entire life.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong><span>Advice from Dana:&nbsp;</span></strong>My recommendation is to focus on the following:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Aim for a big, trusted brand name company in your city.</strong> Since you have never had a full time job, you need to get your resume going —</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">and your peers have a head start! Get a minimum-wage position in a recognizable company, which will give you credibility. To know the companies in your city, read your local Business Journal (bizjournals.com) and invest in the Book of Lists to help you short and long term.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Now focus on what function you want to enter.</strong> Marketing, sales, administration, operations, manufacturing, etc. The Internet has a wealth of knowledge to help you learn how companies are organized, and you can read what different functions do. Do not worry about the industry.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Prepare all of the materials you need for your job search.</strong> There are some amazing books out there to get you current and list all that you need to do.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Now, start the hunt for your role since it may take some time without experience</strong>.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Question from Reader:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Is it OK to refer to notes when answering interview questions?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong><span>Advice from Dana:&nbsp;</span></strong></span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Yes, it is not only okay to refer to your notes, but I highly recommend it when it’s your turn to ask questions.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">When I, the interviewer, say “Greg, do you have any questions for me?”<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>then bring out your list of questions neatly typed.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Make sure you include space between the questions to write down their answers. Do the same for every interview, even if you repeat questions.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In terms of referring to notes when they are asking your questions, yes, but it’s more subtle. I did it all the time.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Have your portfolio open with your resume and the job description. You can have all the notes you want in the margins. On my resume, for example, I had small bullet points of the examples I would give of experiences for each part of my resume. I would write “STORY –<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>Selling to GE”<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>next to my start-up job or “STORY –<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>Hiring 450”<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>next to a job at Microsoft.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In the margins or top of your resume, you can have small reminders of your three strengths and three weaknesses you are going to use throughout.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What you don’t want to do is have to page through numerous papers to find your notes. That’s too obvious.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Question from Reader:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I’m hearing about these new kinds of interviews called “behavioral interviews”<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>where an interviewer asks for stories or examples of what I have done. What is the best way to prepare for the interview and share my stories? I feel that I will either babble on or not share enough. Can you help?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong><span>Advice from Dana:&nbsp;</span></strong>Behavioral-based interviewing is used to discover how the interviewee acted in specific employment-related situations. Logic assumes that the way you behaved in the past will predict how you will behave in the future.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">You are correct —<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>behavioral interviews are increasing in popularity for a number of reasons.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">First, the interviewer can sense if the candidate has prepared for the interview. Most importantly, the interviewer can probe deeper into your experience after hearing your anecdote. You may state an example, then the interviewer will say, “Tell me more about what you did,”<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>or “Tell me more about how you did that,”<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>or “What was your role?”</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It’s really quite simple and effective. An employer has decided what skills are needed (they’re listed in the job description) and will ask questions to find out if the candidate has those skills.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">While you can prepare some effective examples in advance of the interview, I would like to give you a formula for creating an example on the fly, if necessary.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Formula for answering behavioral questions</span></strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Sentence One: The Situation.&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Briefly describe the “what.”&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Example: “During my role as manager at Exxon, the competition was raising its prices, so we had to respond.”</span></li>\r\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Sentence Two: Your Action&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Briefly describe what you did during this situation.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">You are invited to brag and talk about your role in the situation.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Use power verbs, showing confidence and strength.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Avoid using “we”</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">or “the team.”</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">The interviewer needs to learn about you.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Example: “I led a complex set of analyses, summarized the results, and made key recommendations to the leadership team.”</span></li>\r\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Sentence Three: The Result&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Tell how the situation ended —</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">hopefully positively.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Use metrics or numbers, if they are not proprietary. Numbers show the size of the scope or impact.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Example: “As a result, the management team chose to implement one of the recommendations and we increased market share the following year.”</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Now you should prepare your top stories. List out the skills and experiences mentioned in the job description on the left side of a table. On the right, put three bullet points for each row –</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">use short bullets that you will remember.</span><br><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\"></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">If the interviewer asks, “Tell me a time when you had to solve a complex pricing problem,”</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">your notes might read:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Exxon competitive price increases</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Led analysis, summarized, recommended</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Implementation and share percent increased</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Question from Reader:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I would appreciate some advice on job search follow-up after having applied but before being given an interview. What steps should I take to encourage the hiring company to offer me the opportunity to interview?&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Do potential employers expect phone calls or emails to confirm that an application has been received? Do they assume there is a lack of interest if I don’t follow up at that stage in the process?&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I have worked for the same company my entire 36 years of full-time employment, and job hunting is new to me. I am only applying for jobs for which I am fully qualified, so I don’t understand why I’m not getting called in for interviews.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong><span>Advice from Dana:&nbsp;</span></strong>Your followup after applying depends on how you applied, so here are your options:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Applying through a job board, company website, etc:</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">It is very hard to follow up on these since you do not have a contact name. I recommend a two-step process to my clients. One, you need to press “send”<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>on your application using their required tool just to get into their system. However, odds of being called in for an interview are low. Two, you need to network to find an employee who will refer you or someone inside or outside the company to forward your credentials to the hiring manager. And as part of Step 2, you may even forward your own application to a senior manager in that department, advising him or her that you have also applied online.</span></li>\r\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Submitting to a person, either a network contact who offered to refer you, or to an employee of your target company:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">YES, you should follow up within seven working days after the first submittal with another e-mail. Be sure to attach all of your prior correspondence, including your résumé</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">and cover letter, with every follow-up mail. Then you get to do that three more times without being a nuisance.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">So, after the first follow-up e-mail, wait seven more working days and send a different note. Make the emails interesting and informational, rather than “just following up.”&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">No, companies do not assume that you are not interested if you don’t follow up.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">If job searching is new to you, please get current with all of the latest techniques! And I hope you are not applying with just a résumé!</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Question from Reader:&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">How to beat the Internet-based application systems.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I still myself feel frustrated by the ATS (Applicant Tracking System) job application process. Unless certain words are used, and if the resume matches a precise layout, the resume falls into an abyss. The worst thing is that some of the applications can last hours …<span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span>and amount to nothing. Any recommendations?</span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong><span>Advice from Dana:&nbsp;</span></strong></span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Wow! First, you have every right to feel frustrated! I have felt that way throughout all of my job searches.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Now, several solutions come to mind. So, allow me to break it into pieces.</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Try to use more key words in your resume&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\"><strong>How?</strong> Find 10 job descriptions for your target job –</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">they can be anywhere geographically, as this is for research only. Circle the key words they use, find those in common, and make a list. Now review your resume. For example, if you use “sales”</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">in your resume yet they use “business development,”</span><span style=\"font-family: Helvetica;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">change it! Make the same changes in your LinkedIn profile so recruiters, who also use the same key words to search, can find you!&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Just applying to jobs, through an ATS or not, is a flawed strategy&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\">Yes, you need to check the box and file your resume through the company’s system. Now the real action starts! Network your way into the company by finding an employee of the company to refer you or someone who can forward your credentials to the hiring manager.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000; background-color: transparent;\"><strong>Make a great cover letter page one of your resume</strong>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Repeat: your cover letter is NOT a separate attachment, but the first page in the same WORD or PDF document, following the same style and using the same fonts. You can add more key words from the company’s job description to the cover letter here and customize it based on your company research. Do NOT simply regurgitate your resume and, please, cut the use of “I, I, I, me, me, me.”</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In summary, re-boot your approach and add many other job search activities at the same time.</span></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"row\">\r\n<div class=\"col-md-4\">\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"4397\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Dana Manciagli '84\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Dana Manciagli '84\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Dana Manciagli '84\",\"title\":\"Dana Manciagli '84\",\"height\":\"178\",\"width\":\"229\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\"}}]]</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"col-md-8\">\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em><em>Thunderbird School of Global Management alumna Dana Manciagli '84 is the author of \"Cut the crap, Get a job\" and the sole syndicated career columnist for the nationwide Business Journals with her 'Career Mojo' column.&nbsp;</em>Her remarkable profile includes a career in global sales and marketing roles for Fortune 500 corporations like Microsoft, IBM, and Kodak.
