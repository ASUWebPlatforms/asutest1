But job boards as they exist today are no longer effective as a single-pronged recruitment strategy and it’s&nbsp;not&nbsp;enough to&nbsp;simply&nbsp;post an ad waiting for a candidate to bite.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>In fact, many eligible candidates aren’t necessarily scouring job boards every day.&nbsp;According to a recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://about.nexxt.com/infographics/looking-hard/\">survey</a>&nbsp;conducted by&nbsp;Nexxt, 14 percent of respondents said they’re actively searching for a new job, but a much higher number –&nbsp;58 percent –&nbsp;are open to&nbsp;job offers. Meaning,&nbsp;there’s a large gap between the number of candidates open to moving onto the next great opportunity and those actually applying for the job.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Candidates&nbsp;who are not actively&nbsp;looking&nbsp;but&nbsp;are open to opportunities&nbsp;are referred to as “passive.”&nbsp;You might even be one yourself if you don’t feel hot or cold about your job.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>“There are&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;really talented&nbsp;people&nbsp;who lack passion for their current job or company&nbsp;–&nbsp;and that is both a&nbsp;great&nbsp;tragedy and a&nbsp;perfect&nbsp;opportunity&nbsp;for employers to start conversations with&nbsp;these&nbsp;potential candidates,” says&nbsp;Weinlick.&nbsp;“But&nbsp;it takes a lot of&nbsp;effort to apply for new jobs,&nbsp;so employers need to get creative&nbsp;if they want to engage candidates who haven’t committed to that effort yet.”<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>One&nbsp;of the most effective ways to reach the passive&nbsp;qualified&nbsp;candidate&nbsp;who is&nbsp;daydreaming of a new job is through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hiring.nexxt.com/solutions/text-email-campaigns/\">text messaging</a>.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>“Like most people, I’m addicted to my&nbsp;smartphone and,&nbsp;while I might ignore an email,&nbsp;I never ignore a text message,” says&nbsp;Weinlick. “People live on their&nbsp;devices! So as a recruiter, you know any communication you send by text message will be read&nbsp;–&nbsp;and read immediately.”<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>The personalized nature of text message is also a strength for this recruitment tool. A tailored text message addressed to a prospect is more likely to elicit a response than more traditional forms of reaching candidates, and with conversational text products allow recruiters to carry on live&nbsp;conversations with interested candidates.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3>#2&nbsp;Reach Candidates&nbsp;Through&nbsp;Retargeting&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>In addition to text messaging, employers can also take a different approach to advertising&nbsp;their&nbsp;open positions through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hiring.nexxt.com/solutions/retargeting/\">retargeting</a>. This&nbsp;popular online&nbsp;marketing tool, also known as remarketing,&nbsp;has been used by retailers for years. That’s why&nbsp;consumers&nbsp;see those pair of shoes&nbsp;they’ve&nbsp;been lusting over popping up&nbsp;in ads&nbsp;on Facebook and Google days after&nbsp;they first&nbsp;clicked on them on the retailer’s website.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>This marketing technique&nbsp;is&nbsp;proving useful in the recruitment industry as well.&nbsp;With retargeting, that disgruntled worker&nbsp;who&nbsp;clicked on your job advertisement this morning and&nbsp;then got on with their day&nbsp;will now see&nbsp;your&nbsp;job ad pop up as they skim their Facebook timeline or check the score of the game online.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;the perfect way&nbsp;to&nbsp;subtly&nbsp;nudge a candidate&nbsp;to commit to applying for your&nbsp;job.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>With job boards becoming more crowded and&nbsp;less targeted, retargeting is an ideal&nbsp;way to&nbsp;ensure&nbsp;your company’s positions&nbsp;get noticed.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3>#3&nbsp;Rethink Your&nbsp;Recruitment&nbsp;Brand<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>In today’s tight labor market, a company&nbsp;needs to stand out from the competition to attract the most qualified talent.&nbsp;One of the&nbsp;easiest ways to differentiate yourself from the company next door is to&nbsp;strengthen&nbsp;your recruitment brand.&nbsp;Similar to&nbsp;a&nbsp;corporate&nbsp;brand, your recruitment brand communicates important details about your company, but more specifically, it shares with potential applicants what day-to-day life is like as an employee at your organization.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>The key part of your recruitment brand is a single strategic ethos or&nbsp;message&nbsp;that runs through&nbsp;all company communication, from the newsletter to the social media channels to the website.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>“Everything about your brand needs to inspire and motivate,” says&nbsp;Weinlick. “When candidates&nbsp;and employees&nbsp;read your corporate mission statement or job ad,&nbsp;they need to feel something. That feeling should give&nbsp;them&nbsp;the reason to&nbsp;apply to your job or&nbsp;get up and go to work in the morning.”&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>There are a lot of companies with strong recruitment brands, sourcing incredibly qualified talent from around the world&nbsp;– Amazon, Facebook, Google,&nbsp;to name a few. But you don’t have to be a big Silicon Valley powerhouse or even a household name to&nbsp;effectively&nbsp;communicate why it’s great to work at your company. The first steps include&nbsp;revisiting what your brand stands for, fine tuning the&nbsp;feeling and message you&nbsp;give candidates&nbsp;when they visit your&nbsp;external&nbsp;channels, and&nbsp;weaving&nbsp;that message through all company communications.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>What we thought we knew about&nbsp;the recruitment industry&nbsp;is&nbsp;no longer true and&nbsp;the way jobseekers&nbsp;search&nbsp;and apply&nbsp;for jobs&nbsp;has evolved.&nbsp;To&nbsp;keep up&nbsp;with these changes,&nbsp;employers need to reevaluate the&nbsp;way that they recruit. A&nbsp;shrewd recruiter&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;target the 58&nbsp;percent&nbsp;of&nbsp;jobseekers who&nbsp;are open to&nbsp;new roles,&nbsp;use&nbsp;new&nbsp;recruitment&nbsp;tools like text messaging&nbsp;and&nbsp;retargeting to do so, and&nbsp;take&nbsp;a fresh look at their recruitment brand to ensure that what makes their company unique is being communicated&nbsp;well&nbsp;to candidates.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Job boards&nbsp;aren’t going anywhere – they’re still the backbone of any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hiring.nexxt.com/solutions/job-promotion/\">recruitment campaign</a>, but&nbsp;recruiters and employers need to&nbsp;be innovative&nbsp;to&nbsp;get in front of candidates&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;remain&nbsp;relevant&nbsp;in today’s competitive market.</p>\r\n<p><em>Thunderbird School of Global Management Alumna Dana Manciagli '84 is the author of \"Cut the crap, Get a job\".
