He also knew something most CEOs rarely understand: creative types don't react well to due diligence before its time.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Jobs told everyone within hearing range, “you will meet three types of people in your career.” Jobs translated this into a simple paradigm:</p>\r\n<blockquote><span class=\"markup--quote markup--pullquote-quote is-me\" data-creator-ids=\"bd56b52ecbe\">“Gather ten smart people into a conference room and two will be creative, two are great at solving problems, the rest are critics.”</span></blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">That led him to rightly conclude after much trial and error in his early Apple days, one simple act will inspire extraordinary creativity inside the organization:&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">compartmentalize your creative team<em>.</em></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">We are all familiar with what happens when you don’t.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">You have such a cool idea. Of course, you’ve been up all night and there hasn’t been time to check out the pros and cons.&nbsp;<em>By the way, you’re the creative guy in this story if you haven’t figured that out.</em>&nbsp;So you invite everyone to a meeting because by nature you are inclusive and you naively assume everyone wants to hear about a great idea in its infancy. You lay out the early stage notion of the idea. It’s there for everyone to see. It’s so clear, right?</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Bad move.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As you finish your presentation, the guy at the head of the table says, “nice idea, but… (there is always a ‘but’) I think Google is going to crush you (as if they even know who this company is). You better take this up with product management and marketing, then socialize it within the team first. We want to start a revolution here not get into a losing battle. ”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Start a revolution, right? That guy is as wise to revolutions as Louis the XVI.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Now you’re no longer a creative or as Steve Jobs would call it, a maker, but a corporate chess player, and you’ve just heard the business equivalent of checkmate. You got stomped and your idea goes with you. Unfair you say?</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In business, we call creators by another name, founders. It is axiomatic. Creativity is the most powerful economic force known to mankind. But the process isn’t always neat and predictable.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The argument goes that creatives are impractical and “suits” have to rein them in. Some believe antagonism between the two produces stronger products. That is like saying you need a Prussian general to bring up unruly children.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The truth is both attributes are useful — fanciful creativity and the spreadsheet logic of the quants. To harmonize these warring forces you don’t actually have to get rid of the suits. But you might want to take a page out of Jobs’ book and move them to another room.</p>\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"0*i0xVyONiM9-D6MOz.png\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"426\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"0*i0xVyONiM9-D6MOz.png\" data-scroll=\"native\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*i0xVyONiM9-D6MOz.png\" class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*i0xVyONiM9-D6MOz.png\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<span class=\"markup--strong markup--figure-strong\">Apple headquarters, Cupertino, CA</span>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Apple’s circular campus headquarters in Cupertino, nicknamed the ‘spaceship’, has one door that even Steve Jobs could not enter without permission.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It is the room where design happens. It goes by another name as well, innovation.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Don’t feel too bad for Jobs and his successor, Tim Cook, who called it ‘the innovation center’ when he was interviewed by CBS. The vast majority of Apple employees are intentionally prevented from entering into the company’s creative labyrinth, officially known as Design Lab, run by famed designer, Jony Ive. Members of the executive team also discover their badges are no good here.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Here is some stunningly insightful commentary by Jobs on his successor, John Sculley, and why Apple nearly fell apart during that phase, only to reach the highest pinnacle of business enterprise success once Jobs returned. (To be fair, Sculley was a great manager in a disruptive period in Apple’s history).</p>\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"1*yIxi2zGH0tWliB9aWHoeiA.jpeg\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"781\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"1*yIxi2zGH0tWliB9aWHoeiA.jpeg\" data-scroll=\"native\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yIxi2zGH0tWliB9aWHoeiA.jpeg\" class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yIxi2zGH0tWliB9aWHoeiA.jpeg\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">At Apple, there will no tinkering by non-creatives before their time. That is because nobody understood the way creativity drives the bottom line of a business like Steve Jobs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Time after time, he confounded his competitors with products that set the customer’s imagination on fire. But do you remember how at first the critics snubbed their noses at the iPhone? What did Jobs know that they didn’t? Principally, that exposing an early stage product — or company — to the critics too early means it won’t succeed. Instead, he would look for problem solvers, the equivalent of product therapists, to give the creatives a chance to amend product flaws. Jobs knew the critics were not the first but the final stage of market adaptation</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Keep a vigilant guard over the creatives</span></p>\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"0*HOME1MdStYqajY_W.jpg\" data-width=\"408\" data-height=\"288\" data-scroll=\"native\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*HOME1MdStYqajY_W.jpg\" class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*HOME1MdStYqajY_W.jpg\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<span class=\"markup--em markup--figure-em\">Steve Jobs placed Mac team signatures as an artist signs their&nbsp;painting</span>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">In driving Apple where no tech company has gone before, Jobs carefully guarded those few people in the organization who, like himself, possessed an unerring creative skill, and he nurtured them and their ideas.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Let the problem solvers loose</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Then he looked to a larger but still select group of problem solvers who enjoy working out the kinks in new products.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Then throw it to the critics</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Finally, the rest of us, that faceless class of critics that get a kick out of tearing things apart, are brought in to rant and rave. Sort of the corporate version of a political protest. Jobs would let them go to work to toughen the idea (and the team) once it passed through the creative and problem-solving doors.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Adios the suits</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">The key to driving corporate creativity is to make sure the process flows in that order with strong boundaries at each step. Don’t bring in the critics too early; they are nice people but they can also be idea killers.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"section-content\">\r\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\"><span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Author’s Bio</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Jeff Cunningham is a global leadership advocate, which he calls the most valuable natural resource in the world.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">He is a Professor at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thunderbird.edu/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"http://www.thunderbird.edu/\">ASU’s Thunderbird School of Global Management</a>&nbsp;and was the former publisher of Forbes Magazine, an internet CEO and venture capital partner.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">He is a chronicler of iconic leaders.
