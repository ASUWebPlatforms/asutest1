    value: "<p>TEM Lab, Fall 2018<br>Myanmar, Heho Potato<br>Written by Brian Le</p>\r\n<p>Have you ever thought about how the supply chain process of the potatoes on your dinner plate?</p>\r\n<p>Two weeks ago we witnessed our client, Mr. U Chan Htwe, sign a contract for a $185,000 refrigeration system for his agricultural crops. &nbsp;Today, we witnessed wet market-stall owners selling the same produce, of which would have utilized that same refrigeration unit, making less than $4 a day.</p>\r\n<p>The inequities of a developing country is quite staggering to behold. &nbsp;Here you have Myanmar, a country that isolated itself for over half a century, recently opening its borders. &nbsp;As foreign entities flood the market, rapid modernization occurs.&nbsp; Cities grow exponentially, telecommunications spreads throughout all of the country from the urban to rural areas, and information from inside and outside the country is shared.</p>\r\n<p>Industries like agriculture undergo intense transformations. &nbsp;On one end of the agricultural supply chain, a farmer who had just signed a contract valued at $185,000 for a cold-storage warehouse system, and on the other side of the supply chain, individuals that made less than $4 per day retailing the same produce that would have been stored in the aforementioned cold-storage unit. &nbsp;Here is a short summary in the supply chain journey of the potato on your plate:</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div

adds value to the final product. &nbsp;Agribusiness is done in large quantities, upwards of hundreds of metric tons per year per crop. &nbsp;While the margins per potato may be small, given each of the added costs throughout the supply-chain and value-chain process, the sheer amount of potatoes that are dealt with turn a significant profit for the farmers to take these steps. &nbsp;In an industry in which crops are seen as a commodity, it is necessary for farmers to have quality products to command demand and a higher price point.&nbsp; Otherwise, you’d just be small potatoes.</p>\r\n<p>It was fascinating and humbling to see the effects of a free-market economy that has just opened up to the rest of the world. &nbsp;Technological and strategic business changes drive the transformation and innovation of countless industries.&nbsp; When one end of an industry transforms, it is inevitable that the rest of the industry also adapts and changes as well, thus evening out the inequities that are first seen in the early stages of transformation. &nbsp;Overall, as each industry in a country changes, the entire layout of the economy, function of government, and its citizens change with it.</p>\r\n<p>The magnitude of the work we are doing with Winrock and the overarching goal of a self-sufficient Myanmar was then understood.</p>"
