Through the travels we have made and the people we have met, we were able to understand the beauty of Romania. Adversity is a word that might best explain the challenges that these people have lived through; while things may seem bleak to the outsider there is so much hope for a brighter future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"7416\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Romanian home with roof tiles missing from the big storm\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Romanian home with roof tiles missing from the big storm\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Romanian home with roof tiles missing from the big storm\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Romanian home with roof tiles missing from the big storm\"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Romanian home with roof tiles missing from the big storm\",\"title\":\"Romanian home with roof tiles missing from the big storm\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">Romanian home with roof tiles missing after the storm</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>On April 8, 2008, Taparo experienced a devastating fire. Speaking with Mr. Filip (the owner of the company), he shared this story with us on our first day. As our time went on we quickly understood the resounding impact that this incidence has had on the company. Taparo isn’t just a company; it is the life blood of the villages that surround Târgu Lăpuș. When the fire overtook Taparo many wondered if it would be possible to keep the operation running. Thanks to the drive of Mr. Filip and the two other subsidiary manufacturing companies also located in Târgu Lăpuș, they were able to get things back up and running. Recovering from the loss and damages has been a difficult process--one that nine years later they are still trying to overcome.</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"7417\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Mr. Filip, founder and owner of Taparo\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Mr. Filip, founder and owner of Taparo\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Mr. Filip, founder and owner of Taparo\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Mr. Filip, founder and owner of Taparo\"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Mr. Filip, founder and owner of Taparo\",\"title\":\"Mr. Filip, founder and owner of Taparo\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">Mr. Filip, Founder and Owner of Taparo (photo credit Taparo)</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>This last weekend a storm rolled into Romania with wind speeds of 100kmp, a category 1 storm surge.

Taparo, while damaged, didn’t suffer nearly the damages that Sofa Works and EuroComfil Invest did. Both of these businesses owned by the Taparo Group had many roofs blown-off of buildings, the debris slammed against other structures leaving these businesses looking as if a tornado had blown through.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 1849px;\" class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"7421\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Sofaworks Damage\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Sofaworks Damage\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Sofaworks Damage\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Sofaworks Damage\"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Sofaworks Damage\",\"title\":\"Sofaworks Damage\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">Sofa Works Damage</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"7422\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"ECI Damage\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"ECI Damage\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"ECI Damage\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"ECI Damage\"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"ECI Damage\",\"title\":\"ECI Damage\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\"><span>EuroComfil Invest</span>&nbsp;Damage</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"7423\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"The following days resulted in piles of debris like this all around the county\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"The following days resulted in piles of debris like this all around the county\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"The following days resulted in piles of debris like this all around the county\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"The following days resulted in piles of debris like this all around the county\"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"The following days resulted in piles of debris like this all around the county\",\"title\":\"The following days resulted in piles of debris like this all around the county\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">The following days resulted in piles of debris all around the county</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>In the face of this devastating storm what we found was a community: people who knew how to rally against all odds to overcome the current adversity they were facing. Monday morning Mr. Filip was onsite determining to continue operations. By midday they were up and running. Speaking with the people this week we have seen what fortitude is, and how impactful it can be within a small close-knit community. While they still have much to overcome the people of Romania will find a way.</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 1849px;\" class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"7425\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"The hospital had half of its roof blown off\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"The hospital had half of its roof blown off\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"The hospital had half of its roof blown off\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"The hospital had half of its roof blown off\"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"The hospital had half of its roof blown off\",\"title\":\"The hospital had half of its roof blown off\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">The hospital had half of its roof destroyed</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div style=\"width: 1171px;\" class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"7426\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Destruction in the streets\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Destruction in the streets\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Destruction in the streets\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Destruction in the streets\"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Destruction in the streets\",\"title\":\"Destruction in the streets\",\"height\":\"650\",\"width\":\"1171\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]</div>\r\n<div style=\"width: 932px;\" class=\"caption-inner\">Destruction in the streets</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div style=\"width: 1162px;\" class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"7429\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Sunset after the storm\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Sunset after the storm\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Sunset after the storm\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Sunset after the storm\"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Sunset after the storm\",\"title\":\"Sunset after the storm\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"7415\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"After the big storm we were quickly reminded of the beauty that this region has to offer despite destruction all around\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"After the big storm we were quickly reminded of the beauty that this region has to offer despite destruction all around\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"After the big storm we were quickly reminded of the beauty that this region has to offer despite destruction all around\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"After the big storm we were quickly reminded of the beauty that this region has to offer despite destruction all around\"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"After the big storm we were quickly reminded of the beauty that this region has to offer despite destruction all around\",\"title\":\"After the big storm we were quickly reminded of the beauty that this region has to offer despite destruction all around\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">After the storm we were quickly reminded of the beauty that this region has to offer despite destruction all around</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>"
