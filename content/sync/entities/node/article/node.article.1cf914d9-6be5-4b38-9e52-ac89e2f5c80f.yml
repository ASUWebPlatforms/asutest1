    value: "<p>Fruandes (fruits from the Andes) is a company dedicated to producing organic tropical dried fruit (banana, cane sugar, dragon fruit, gold berries, mango and pineapple). Giovanni Porras, an agricultural engineer who wanted to make a difference for the Colombian small producers, founded the company in the early 2000s. As part of various NGOs, Giovanni had been working for years with farmers and wanted to increase the positive impact he made in the country. Short time after he met an investor, Hugo Ciró, he went to&nbsp;<span>Canada to learn the optimum dried fruit processing methods and they started a business venture together.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span><img src=\"/sites/default/files/avilvmp1epiee50mrpi0eykyev0qpk_ief7v8tgeklo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"437\" height=\"350\" class=\"Image img__fid__1942 img__view_mode__default\"><em></em></p>\r\n<p><em>Fruandes Processing Plant in Bogota, Colombia.</em></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/mcx65kaapwf1fsoe1q_2etjolk-raykr0ir1w5414li.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"480\" height=\"360\" class=\"Image img__fid__1943 img__view_mode__default\"><em></em></p>\r\n<p><em>T-birds Alina Buzgar and Ana Carrillo are welcomed.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p><span>Fruandes has grown steadily over the past 15 years, and in the late 2000s, when Javi</span><span>er Vázquez joined the team, the compan</span><span>y expanded its operations internationally and solidified its promise to become an exclusively organic producer. Fruandes manages its supply chain diligently in order to preserve their USDA and European organic certifications. Their sourcing (high quality organic produce) and production process (optimal temperature, packaging and shelf life management) have differentiated their products allowing them to grow exponentially.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>"
