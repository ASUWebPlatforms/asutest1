    value: "<p>It was a calm breezy morning November 22, 2013 when I entered the admissions office to start my usual daily work as a Graduate Assistant. Following a lovely ritual of&nbsp;exchanging greetings with the ever-smiling Sandra, positive-spirited Michelle, and Katie, I was met with the most exciting news to begin my day – a prospective student had just called the school from my country of Ghana to make enquiries on our program offerings and was very interested in starting a graduate degree in Fall 2014.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"3030\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird Hosts Former First Lady of Ghana, Nana Konadu Agyeman\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false},\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Thunderbird Hosts Former First Lady of Ghana, Nana Konadu Agyeman\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\"}}]]</p>\r\n<p>He had heard of Thunderbird School of Global Management from a local radio feature, and&nbsp;read from the online and print media of an excellent speaker session hosted last Tuesday, November 19, 2013 for Ghana’s former first lady, Her Excellency, Mrs. Nana Konadu Agyeman-Rawlings. She is&nbsp;also the Founder and Executive President of the 31st December Women’s Movement (31stDWM) – a grassroots NGO that empowers women economically, politically, socially and culturally.</p>\r\n<p>A moment of history that has lived through my heart since I met this extraordinary woman for the very first time in my entire life, after knowing her and the first family solely through sociopolitical news items on&nbsp;print and electronic media. Beyond sharing some of her personal challenges working to improve livelihoods of impoverished women&nbsp;and children through her influence as first lady, she carefully laid out a premise for her argument that “GDP alone is not a sufficient measure of well being,” while speaking on the topic, “<em>Development, Politics, and National Government: The Impact on African Women.\"&nbsp;</em>She had earlier shared her work mantra, centrally themed from the quote&nbsp;<em>\"If you educate a man, you educate an individual but if you educate a woman, you educate a whole nation\" (Dr. Kwegyir Aggrey).</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n<p>Sitting through the lecture, I couldn’t help but understand from another perspective the reasons why Thunderbird breeds leaders who see beyond the ordinary in every&nbsp;situation. For once, it felt as if she had been through a Thunderbird experience when her profile was read out, but she was more than one of us – an influencer from the other end for T-birds and other upcoming leaders. The calmness and general warmness with which she received and answered questions from the audience and interacted with them afterwards was really amazing – a very humbling presence.</p>\r\n<p>To crown such an awesome time, shaking her hand and presenting her with a Thank You gift on behalf of the school was a unique moment which echoed a statement I made to Mrs. Erika Amoako-Adjei, the amazing woman who made all this happen, \"<em>This was simply an excellent night of brilliance.\"</em></p>\r\n<p>I look forward to seeing Thunderbird for Good build on this opportunity and extend its reach to Africa, changing lives - many women at a time.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Thank you Your Excellency, we have been really honored by your presence amongst us.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Thank you, The Office of President Penley, for co-sponsoring the event and providing refreshments for the reception that followed.</p>\r\n<p>Thank you, Thunderbird for Good for organizing the visit, coordinating with student clubs, and hosting this distinguished guest.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks, to the African Business Club for co-sponsoring the event and doing a great job of bringing the campus community out.</p>\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"3031\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Thunderbird Hosts Former First Lady of Ghana, Nana Konadu Agyeman\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false},\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Thunderbird Hosts Former First Lady of Ghana, Nana Konadu Agyeman\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\"}}]]</p>\r\n<p><span><em>From left: Djoudie Etoundi Essomba '13, Danielle Rinderknecht '14,&nbsp;Erika Amoako-Agyei, President Larry Penley, H.E. Mrs. Agyeman-Rawlings, Nicole Mueller '14, and Barry Kofi King '14&nbsp;</em></span></p>"
