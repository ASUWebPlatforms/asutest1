It was then that she decided to go back to her roots, opening a donut shop based off her grandmother’s recipe and her mother’s inspiration. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;\"> </span><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Flora opened </span><a href=\"http://www.deliciasdelnorte.com.ni/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #0563c1; font-family: Calibri;\">Delicias del Norte</span></span></a><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\"> in 2005 with a friend who had studied entrepreneurship through Thunderbird for Good programs.
