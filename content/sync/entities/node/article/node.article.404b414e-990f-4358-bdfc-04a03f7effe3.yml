Missed passes, indecision and basic errors at the set piece opened the door as Ireland took a stranglehold on the game. After promising progress, Scotland must now analyse and work on the areas which let them down&nbsp;today.”</span></blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">If your idea of disruption is what happened to Oscar Munoz, CEO of United Airlines, just ask one of the Scottish women rugby players who clashed with the Irish for a 3–73 loss.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">When the CEO job at United becomes available, I know a few female ruggers happy to take on belligerent passengers — and airline rules only a lunatic could admire. They know what some CEOs are just now learning, disruption is usually self-inflicted not caused. In fact, as I’ll go into later, most disruptors don’t even know who they’re going to disrupt.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"section-content\">\r\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf--leading\"><span class=\"markup--strong markup--h3-strong\">Disruption used to come in several flavors, all of them&nbsp;bitter.</span></h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Now, the recipe includes&nbsp;<strong><span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">competitors</span></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">regulators</span></strong>, but also the mainstream&nbsp;<strong><span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">anti-business media</span></strong>, digital<strong>&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">click-baiters like Buzzfeed</span></strong>, virtue signaling&nbsp;<strong><span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">humanitarians</span></strong>, environmental&nbsp;<strong><span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">activists</span></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">plaintiff attorneys</span></strong>&nbsp;who pay the&nbsp;<strong><span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">politicians</span></strong>&nbsp;and politicians who vote for laws that enrich the attorneys, and since the 1989&nbsp;<strong><span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Whistleblower</span>&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">Protection Act</span></strong>, your own&nbsp;<strong><span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">employees</span></strong>, and for at least one airline, belligerent&nbsp;<strong><span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">customers</span></strong>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The question a CEO needs to ask herself, “were you disrupted or was it self-inflicted?” Did those forces come after you or did you allow them a foot in the door or in the mouth, or in the case of United, an open invitation?</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">In my experience, disruption starts with three things all of which are the result of <strong>1)&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">too much on your radar</span>&nbsp;(complexity), 2)&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">inattention to soft signals from your own people&nbsp;</span>(elitism) and 3)&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\">failure to heed warnings from the market</span>&nbsp;(arrogance).</strong> The cure is to get off your high horse and into the scrum, or in the case of a CEO, the market, where disruption begins. If you catch it early, you beat disruption or you join it. Either way you win.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"section-content\">\r\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf--leading\">The Last To&nbsp;Know</h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">There has been no greater disruptor in history than Google. Yet take a look at the timeline and how many chances so many had a chance to make Google go away because at the time, they did not realize they were disrupting.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Today, Google and Facebook account for 80% of all online ad spending. All advertising will eventually succumb to the ROI targeted accuracy of online because advertisers need justification for ad spend. Google figured it out, but they didn’t know it at the time.</p>\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"0*7aGMMZ_UHhjmUJTS.JPG\" data-width=\"800\" data-height=\"600\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"0*7aGMMZ_UHhjmUJTS.JPG\" data-scroll=\"native\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*7aGMMZ_UHhjmUJTS.JPG\" class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*7aGMMZ_UHhjmUJTS.JPG\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\nGoogle’s garage was the first headquarters\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">History of a disruptor:</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Two students, Larry Page 23 and Sergey Brin 24, were pursuing their Ph.D. at Stanford, when they got the idea to create a new search engine.</li>\r\n<li>They did not like each other.</li>\r\n<li>Their original goal was to sell Google for $1 million.</li>\r\n<li>They originally called it by its more accurately spelled name, Googol (A&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">googol</span>&nbsp;is simply a big number: 1 followed by one hundred 0's). But they received a $100,000 paycheck made out to Google Inc. and had to create a bank account under the name to cash it.</li>\r\n<li>In 1997, Yahoo rejected an offer to buy Google for $1 million.</li>\r\n<li>Google is now worth $350 billion give or take some disruption in the value range.</li>\r\n</ol></div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"section-content\">\r\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\">Take a page from the Scottish Women’s Rugby team the next time you and your colleagues are meeting and want to figure out how to beat disruption. Camaraderie and shared ideals aren’t enough. They know it takes more than a village to beat disruption.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">There are six steps you need to take that will feel both obvious and difficult at the same&nbsp;time:</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>As Alcoholics Anonymous says, first thing is to&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">admit you have a problem</span>&nbsp;before you get disrupted.</li>\r\n<li>Then after you discover the problem,&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">get it out there, work on it, fix it fast, experiment</span>, share broadly with your entire team, you have only time to lose.</li>\r\n<li>Change the&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">incentive structure radically</span>&nbsp;(because it isn’t working and you’re spending money foolishly) and make sure you monitor it like an investment, not a cost.</li>\r\n<li>Fix what the&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Six Sigma guys call fatal errors</span>&nbsp;and don’t waste too much time correcting minor defects that a democratic vote would suggest<span class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">.</span></li>\r\n<li><span class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">You have to do some housecleaning.</span>&nbsp;If you’re not the problem (and double check that point) it could mean firing the people whose job it is to watch the front lines, like your CMO, PR firm, and CFO all in one week. Disruption will take their jobs away later anyway. But cleaning house can infuse energy and esprit de corps in the rank and file, and those are the ones you really need to get you through the tough times ahead.</li>\r\n<li><span class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">Be absolutely clear with your people</span>&nbsp;about the challenges, the burdens you bear, your willingness to take them with you to the top. Promise them a rainbow when it’s over, but they must know a rocky trip will intercede between now and then.</li>\r\n<li>Understand&nbsp;<span class=\"markup--strong markup--li-strong\">disruption is a force and it may not allow your company to survive</span>. But there are thrivers and survivors, if you move quickly to get ahead of the trend, you’ll be among the winners no matter how the chips fall.</li>\r\n</ol></div>\r\n</div>"
