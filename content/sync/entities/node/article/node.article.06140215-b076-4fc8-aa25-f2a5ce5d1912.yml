Technology&nbsp;has&nbsp;made business more open, more transparent,&nbsp;and&nbsp;has&nbsp;given everyone&nbsp;– including customers and organizations –&nbsp;more choice.&nbsp;With that comes&nbsp;skills that are needed one minute and gone the next&nbsp;– just like waves in the ocean.</p>\r\n<p>Companies&nbsp;have had&nbsp;to adapt&nbsp;quickly,&nbsp;and&nbsp;it has exposed employees&nbsp;who have held&nbsp;onto the old ways of doing things.&nbsp;Embrace&nbsp;the&nbsp;change that is happening, accept it and&nbsp;use it as a way to identify what skills companies need now, which ones you have and which ones you need to develop&nbsp;for the future.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3><span>Adopt a Progression-Based Mindset</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335559685&quot;:360}\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>With conditions changing so rapidly within industries, the skills needed are becoming more technical and&nbsp;more specific.&nbsp;If you&nbsp;are of the&nbsp;mindset that your skills are fixed, you are going to struggle&nbsp;to&nbsp;build&nbsp;new skills.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Surfers have what is called a&nbsp;<i>progression-based m</i><i>indset</i>.&nbsp;Much like a growth mindset, they think of their skills as always&nbsp;progressing.&nbsp;In business we think of our skills as fixed and we look for new jobs that “align with that skill set.”&nbsp;We need to think about our skills as always&nbsp;progressing&nbsp;if we want to meet the&nbsp;new&nbsp;demands of disruptive markets.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3><span>Explore Risk and Use It&nbsp;As&nbsp;a Compass</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335559685&quot;:360}\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>One of the biggest obstacles holding anyone back from making a career change is the&nbsp;fear of – and&nbsp;risk involved in&nbsp;–&nbsp;doing something new. The uncertainty of a new role, having new coworkers,&nbsp;and&nbsp;anticipating&nbsp;the&nbsp;future success&nbsp;of an organization can be daunting. It can keep even the most talented and skilled professional from exploring a new opportunity.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Instead, see&nbsp;the risk involved&nbsp;with this change&nbsp;as a&nbsp;positive&nbsp;sign. Greater responsibilities or having to work with&nbsp;more talented teams&nbsp;can&nbsp;create&nbsp;extreme&nbsp;levels of stress and&nbsp;anxiety.&nbsp;But, it could also do something your previous job could not,&nbsp;take you to the next level in your career.</p>\r\n<p>The business leaders that embrace change, adopt a new mindset,&nbsp;and take on the risks involved with a career change, will not only survive, but will thrive in the new conditions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Thunderbird School of Global Management Alumna Dana Manciagli '84 is the author of \"Cut the crap, Get a job\".
