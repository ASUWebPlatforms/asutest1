Approximately 20 women and their male family members attended. When the men arrived, they all filled out a survey relating to male support of women’s education and business and received brochures and other information relating to the program.</p><p>Hanifa Fatemi from Cohort 5 opened the session with a beautiful Islamic blessing. Course Manager Zobaida Haji Rasoul introduced all the staff members that were present. Amanda Carson then provided an overview of the program, explaining the partnership between Goldman Sachs, Thunderbird and AUAF. Veteran program instructor Fauzia Assifi led the rest of the session, describing the course structure, curriculum and wraparound services provided for all women in the program. She also emphasized the value of the program as well as why it is so important to have family support and buy-in.</p><p>At the end of the presentation, Zobaida introduced five&nbsp;<em>10,000 Women</em>&nbsp;graduates who recently received awards from a business plan competition held by GIZ (German International Zusammenarbiet) and USAID: Hanifa Fatemi, Hasina Mahbobi, Shema Shafiq Sadat, Kamela Anwari and Noor Jahan Mohamadi. The group received a standing ovation and served as an inspiration for the current students and recent graduates as well as their male family members.</p><div><div>[[{"fid":"2981","view_mode":"default","fields":{"format":"default","field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]":"Moving Forward Together - men supporting women in Afghanistan","field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]":false},"type":"media","link_text":null,"field_deltas":{"2":{"format":"default","field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]":"Moving Forward Together - men supporting women in Afghanistan","field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]":false}},"attributes":{"alt":"Moving Forward Together - men supporting women in Afghanistan","class":"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default","data-delta":"2"}}]]</div><p>Recent business plan award winners are recognized: (from left) Course Manager Zobaida Rasoul, Kamela Anwari, Norr Jahan Mohmadi, Hasina Mahbobi, alumni association leader Malalai Jawad, Hanifa Fatemi, and Shama Shafeq Sadat</p></div><p>All the husbands, fathers and brothers seemed really interested in the program and very supportive of their female family members. At the end of the presentation, Deborah Barrett led a discussion to gather additional information and answers to some of the questions that posed in the survey. By the end of the session, about 15 men agreed to form the first ever “Men’s Support Group for Women in Afghanistan.” All the men gave their contact information and seemed excited to be a part of this revolutionary new group.</p>'
