We may never know the exact global DNA of the game, but we do know that the popularity of baseball has expanded across borders. With 29.8% of 2017 players being born outside of the United States, Major League Baseball is now more global than it has ever been. Dominican Republic native, and Thunderbird alumnus, <a href=\"http://m.dbacks.mlb.com/news/article/209782320/baseball-a-special-force-in-dominican-republic/\">Hatuey “Chuy” Mendoza '16</a> knows this more than anyone.</p>\r\n<p>“Twenty years ago, baseball brought me to America to play this fascinating game; and every year the game brings new players to the United States,” says Chuy. \"All of these baseball players come to the sport bringing with them various cultures--but with a common dream: to become a Major League Baseball player.\"</p>\r\n<p>Since finishing his own pitching career with the Diamondbacks in 2006, Mendoza has been the D-backs' Coordinator for Latin American Operations. He focuses his time on developing new young talent in Latin America. The <a href=\"http://m.dbacks.mlb.com/news/article/209155422/d-backs-provide-education-at-dominican-academy/\">Diamondbacks Academy in Boca Chica</a>, Dominican Republic, prepares young baseball players for a future baseball career and also provides high-quality education for life beyond baseball. With a growing number of teams competing for Latin American talent, the Diamondbacks sent Mendoza to Thunderbird in 2014 to gain them an advantage.</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"7375\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Hatuey “Chuy” Mendoza - Executive Master of Global Management\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Hatuey “Chuy” Mendoza - Executive Master of Global Management\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"2\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Hatuey “Chuy” Mendoza - Executive Master of Global Management\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Hatuey “Chuy” Mendoza - Executive Master of Global Management\"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Hatuey “Chuy” Mendoza - Executive Master of Global Management\",\"title\":\"Hatuey “Chuy” Mendoza - Executive Master of Global Management\",\"style\":\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"2\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">Chuy with D-backs President &amp; CEO Derrick Hall</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>“Chuy is a role model for so many of his colleagues because of his work ethic and the incredible journey he has taken to reach his current position,” says <a href=\"http://arizona.diamondbacks.mlb.com/ari/team/exec_bios/hall_derrick.jsp\">D-backs President &amp; CEO Derrick Hall</a>. “The Latin American market, including his home country of the Dominican Republic, is a great place for us to find talent on the field, but it has also provided us with high-quality front office members, coaches and executive.\"</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\"To be successful in this game, you must know more than just the business of baseball; and, understanding both our culture and foreign cultures has been very valuable to Chuy and the D-backs,\" says Hall.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>A professional baseball player isn’t who most people expect to find sitting next to them in an <a href=\"/node/4\">international business degree program</a>. One of Chuy's classmates, Kevin Allen, remembers uncertainty about how the program would impact a baseball player.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>“Within a couple of months, Chuy became everyone's favorite classmate and by graduation he outshined most of us as he absorbed all that the school offered,\" says Allen. \"He was immediately implementing what we were learning and was sharing with us his significant results.
