Attempting to repatriate&nbsp;(return to the country of origin)&nbsp;these&nbsp;t-shirts to the U.S., Rothstein and&nbsp;Lohr&nbsp;founded&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.projectrepat.com/\">Project&nbsp;Repat</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;created a solution for Americans to keep their sentimental t-shirts by repurposing them into&nbsp;quilts.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>“We knew there was an endless amount of clothes, and many of the clothes that were donated ended up in landfills,” Rothstein said. “We launched the t-shirt quilts on Groupon, and sold 2,000 in a week! There was pent up demand in the marketplace for an affordable t-shirt quilt.”<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>In the five years since introducing the quilts, Project&nbsp;Repat&nbsp;has sold over 150,000.&nbsp;Creating the unique product filled a need that few realized was there.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>“If you offer something, and you don’t have to tell the story behind it, and it’s solving a problem for&nbsp;people, then you have the right idea,”&nbsp;Rothstein said&nbsp;of finding the right idea to start a business around.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2><span>Remember to&nbsp;Team&nbsp;B</span><span>uild</span>&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></h2>\r\n<p>Three million students take the&nbsp;SAT or ACT&nbsp;tests every year, creating an evergreen&nbsp;market for a solution that could help students study for and succeed at these defining tests.&nbsp;To help students and parents with this preparation,&nbsp;Tom&nbsp;Rose&nbsp;(34)&nbsp;founded&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.testive.com/\">Testive</a>, an online modernized approach to studying for the SAT and ACT. He combined his two careers – engineering and education – to create a unique combination of technology and education for optimal learning and preparation.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>“Navigating the test prep process is rife with anxiety, especially in this day of hyper-scheduled kids,” Rose said. “Diminishing&nbsp;that fear by being prepared and confident is a universal need that parents and students alike want to address.”<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Testive&nbsp;offers a personalized experience for each student to unlock their individual potential, and aids&nbsp;with&nbsp;planning, assessing, and coaching for success. The goal is to humanize education, and instead of just throwing information at students,&nbsp;Testive&nbsp;helps them&nbsp;absorb it&nbsp;while motivating them to learn more. Rose&nbsp;has created a better solution&nbsp;for students nationwide, and has created an innovative business around this unique issue.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>His team of developers and educators has successfully encouraged hundreds of students, but they also found support within their own team.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>“Not only is it impossible to do everything by myself,” Rose said. “But team building is more important than sales growth. Sales can happen at any time, but team building takes slow, deliberate persistence.”<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Like these five founders demonstrate, the&nbsp;path to success&nbsp;isn’t limited to&nbsp;climbing the corporate ladder.&nbsp;Finding an innovative solution and building a business from the ground up is still the American dream.</p>\r\n<p>Join Dana Manciagli’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://danamanciagl.samcart.com/referral/ihc4Zdak/mHDAKfwajfZgTWDa\">Job Search Master Class</a>&nbsp;right now and immediately access the most comprehensive job search system currently available!</p>\r\n<p><em>Thunderbird School of Global Management Alumna Dana Manciagli '84 is the author of \"Cut the crap, Get a job\".
