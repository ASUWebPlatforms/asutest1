    value: "<p>By Anubhav Sharma</p>\r\n<p>The only way to predict the future is to have the power to shape the future. From ancient times, science and religion have always clashed together but the former ends up giving a logical explanation to people’s beliefs, that are usually based on superstition or religion. We have always seen in movies how Gods predict the future, create anything on their own, fly without piloting their planes, cure anyone from diseases, and for doing all this, they do not need wealth or equipment. What if today, humans are able to do that? Imagine if everything in your life is automated and is controlled just by the imagination! With the advent of sharing economic business model, the world has become exposed to new ways of doing business and using resources. Over the last decade, companies such as Uber, Airbnb, Task Rabbit, Lending club, Lyft, and many more have changed the traditional way of doing business.</p>\r\n<p>The speed at which industries, technology and business models are changing is very fast. Along with this rapid change, a new buzz word which is being talked about is Internet of Things. It has the power to connect everything around us and make all vivid imaginations real.

To make this imagination a reality, a change is required in the way we do business today.</p>\r\n<p>To read more on this and other&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;articles By Anubhav Sharme click on the following link <a href=\"http://anubhavtbird.weebly.com/blog\">http://anubhavtbird.weebly.com/blog</a></p>"
