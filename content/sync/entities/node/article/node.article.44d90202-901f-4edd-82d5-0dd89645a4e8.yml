AWIU is a non-profit, non-governmental 501c(3) organization founded to bring together women in leadership positions to engage in and encourage citizen diplomacy throughout the world. Through these actions, the group hopes to build bridges of understanding, goodwill, and cooperation between women leaders and further the empowerment of women globally.</p>\r\n<p>Thunderbird for Good was recognized at the dinner as the ‘Salute Group’ for the event, acknowledging the work that we have been doing to educate over 75,000 women entrepreneurs in 25 emerging economies such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Peru, and beyond since our formation in 2005. A “Salute Group” is a non-profit organization with international scope, which raises the awareness of and contributes significantly to world understanding of gender issues. Each year Salute Groups are honored based on the quality and effectiveness of their work in empowering and bringing positive change to women and children worldwide.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;[[{\"fid\":\"2865\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"International Women's Day\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false},\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"International Women's Day\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\"}}]]</p>\r\n<p>The International Women of Courage Award was established by the U.S. Department of State in 2007 to honor women in tribute to International Women’s Day who are bravely making a substantial difference in the lives of women around the globe, often at great personal risk. The<a href=\"http://www.state.gov/s/gwi/programs/iwoc/2013/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;International Women of Courage</a>&nbsp;come from all walks of life, and share the same deep felt commitment to promote the rights and freedoms of women and children. The awardees are role models for women worldwide, committed to helping women improve their lives in the workplace, gaining freedom of education and improving the status of women around the globe. The 10 women being honored this year are truly amazing, and we were honored to be recognized for our work alongside them.</p>\r\n<p>The Thunderbird for Good table was filled with program partners such as the Inter-American Development Bank and the Global Business School Network, as well as many Washington DC area alumni, making for a great evening of reminiscing, catching up on each other’s work, and being inspired by the incredible IWOC awardees.&nbsp; Also at the event was former Thunderbird Interim President, Ambassador Barrett, one of Thunderbird for Goods strongest supporters and the founder of Project Artemis Afghanistan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;[[{\"fid\":\"2866\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"International Women's Day\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false},\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"International Women's Day\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\"}}]]</p>\r\n<p>In addition to hearing from AWIU members and honorees, the audience was thrilled by the musical talents of The Dan Dufford Trio and vocalist Lena Seikaly, who performed inspirational works written by American women composers and vocalists.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Josephine Obiajulu Odumakin, the awardee from Nigeria spoke eloquently on behalf of all of the IWOC awardees at the dinner, saying “the more we stand together, the more power and the bigger difference we will create.&nbsp; We will have a world that is just, and that is free.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The International Women of Courage were so inspiring; it would be negligent NOT to share their stories with you:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Malalai Bahaduri - Afghanistan</strong>, 1<span>st</span>&nbsp;Sergeant, Afghan National Interdiction Unit, Senior Instructor</p>\r\n<p>Malalai’s story of perseverance begins at age 2, when her parents moved with her from Wardak to Kabul.&nbsp; Through the Soviet occupation, the Civil War, and the Talibal regime, Malalai persevered to complete her education through the 12<span>th</span>grade.&nbsp; In 2002, Malalai, a married mother of three, decided to pursue a career in law enforcement with the support of her family.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>She was selected to become the 1<span>st</span>&nbsp;woman member of the Afghan National Interdiction Unit, and has become a senior instructor, playing an integral role in the Afghan effort to target and prosecute drug traffickers.&nbsp; Despite her success and recognition, her career choice has attracted many death threats, and physical assaults.&nbsp; First Sergeant Bahaduri works for a day when women and men will be viewed as equals, when women will enjoy equal rights before the law, and be able to pursue whatever&nbsp; dreams they may possess.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Tsering Woeser (Wei Se) - China</strong>, Tibetan author, poet, and blogger</p>\r\n<p>Tsering has emerged as one of the most prominent activists speaking out publicly about human rights conditions for China’s Tibetan citizens.&nbsp; Born in Lhasa, Tsering has given voice to millions of ethnic Tibetans who are prevented from expressing themselves to the outside world due to Chinese government efforts to curtail the free flow of information.&nbsp; Despite being placed under house arrest during “politically sensitive” periods of time, Ms. Woeser persists in documenting the Tibetan situation, and asserting that “the more than 100 Tibetans who have expressed their desire to resist the forces of oppression by bathing their bodies in fire are the reason why I will not give up, and why I will not compromise.”&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Julieta Castellanos – Honduras</strong>, Rector, National Autonomous University of Honduras</p>\r\n<p>Julieta has repeatedly played a central role in efforts to overcome the enormous challenges afflicting Honduras.&nbsp; Through her work on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, she helped her nation recover from violent political polarization following a coup d’etat.&nbsp; She was instrumental in forming an umbrella organization for more than 400 organizations that have given civil society a more powerful voice, and she has pressed relentlessly for systemic reform of the country’s police and justice sector institutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Nirbhaya – India</strong></p>\r\n<p>Nirbhaya, or “Fearless”, this courageous 23 year old physiotherapy intern’s brutal gang rape on a moving bus in Delhi in December inspired widespread protests, and has become the foundation of a popular movement to end violence against women in India.&nbsp; Nirbhaya bravely recorded two police statements while in the hospital, repeatedly called for justice against the six attackers, and stated her will to see justice done before her death just two weeks after the attack.&nbsp; In the wake of her death, Indian citizens and the government have begun to advocate for and take action to ensure higher rape conviction and arrest rates and create a more gender sensitive justice system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Dr. Josephine Obiajulu Odumakin – Nigeria</strong>, President, Campaign for Democracy</p>\r\n<p>Dr. Odumakin has handled over 2,000 cases of vilations of women’s rights in the past 20 years.&nbsp; These cases have included assaults and killings by law enforcement, as well as the deaths of women and children due to negligence on the part of school or hospital authorities.&nbsp; Josephine leads almost every protest, march, lecture, or workshop aimed at encouraging the rule of law and democracy, leading her to be arrested and detained 17 times during General Babangida’s regime.&nbsp; Dr. Odumakin is currently the Executive Director of the Institute of Human Rights and Democratic Studies, and is a leader in many additional human rights and civil society strengthening organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Elena Milashina – Russia</strong>, Journalist and human rights activist</p>\r\n<p>Regarded as one of the most experienced and influential investigative journalists in Russia, Elena has spent her career shining light on events others shy away from, including drug trafficking, terrorist attacks, military disasters, and even the killing of fellow journalists.&nbsp; She is an ardent opponent of the extrajudicial kidnappings and torture that plague areas of Russia and is outspoken against xenophobia and racism.&nbsp; She has received threats and physical and verbal attacks for her work, but she continues to provide a voice exemplifying commitment to the highest human standards.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fartuun Adan – Somalia</strong>, Executive Director, Elman Peace and Human Rights Centre</p>\r\n<p>Fartun is the Executive Director of the Elman Peace and Human Rights Center in Mogadishu, Somalia.&nbsp; Ms. Adan has championed human and women’s rights, peace-building, development, and the rehabilitation of child soldiers across Somalia.&nbsp; In 1996, Somali warlords assassinated her husband for his peacekeeping efforts at her side.&nbsp; After his assassination, she fled to Canada where she raised three daughters before returning to Mogadishu in 2007 during the height of the conflict.&nbsp; In 2010, Ms. Adan initiated a program to support victims of rape and forced marriage.&nbsp; In 2011 she established the 1<span>st</span>&nbsp;sexual violence hotline and rape crisis center in Somalia.&nbsp; To date her efforts have served over 400 Somali women and girls, and has trained an average of 350 former child soldiers each year, enabling them to fill jobs created by the exodus of skilled workers who fled Mogadishu’s violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Razan Zeitunah – Syr</strong>ia, Human Rights Lawyer, Founder of Local Coordination Committees</p>\r\n<p>Razan was forced into hiding 22 months ago after the Syrian government accused her of being a foreign agent for reporting atrocities against civilians, and imprisoned her husband.&nbsp; She is now a leading voice in the Syrian revolution, even from hiding. She worked with the Human Rights Association of Syria to monitor and expose human rights violations perpetrated by the Syrian authorities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Ta Phong Tan – Vietnam</strong>, blogger</p>\r\n<p>Ta Phong Tan is a ground-breaking blogger currently serving a 10 year prison sentence in Vietnam.&nbsp; After publishing online articles criticizing the policies of the Communist Party of Vietnam, she was expelled from her role as an officer in the Vietnamese security forces.&nbsp; In 2006, Ms. Tan started her blog “Truth and Justice,” posting essays and exposes online, becoming one of the first bloggers to write and comment on political news long considered off-limits.&nbsp; In 2011 she was arrested and convicted of conducting propaganda against the state.</p>"
