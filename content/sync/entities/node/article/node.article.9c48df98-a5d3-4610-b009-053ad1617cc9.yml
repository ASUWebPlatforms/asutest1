It wasn’t until a close friend died of pancreatic cancer that Jacobsmuhlen knew he wanted to live his everyday life differently. The wake-up call took him back to school, where he earned a master’s degree in applied linguistics and landed a job with Samsung in Seoul, South Korea. It was there, working in Samsung’s HR development center and helping people prepare for overseas assignments, that his interest in Thunderbird was rekindled.</p>\r\n<p>“It was unfinished business,” Jacobsmuhlen said. “Now that I have my MBA, my goal is to do something to contribute, to inspire people to be the best that they can be and to help them create an impact around them. The concept of retirement doesn’t appeal to me.”</p>"
