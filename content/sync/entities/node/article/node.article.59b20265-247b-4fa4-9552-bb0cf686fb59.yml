    value: "<p>After two weeks of business trainings, site visits to women owned businesses in Arizona, and meeting the mentors that will help these extraordinary Afghan businesswomen improve and expand their businesses, the entire group of 19 Artemis graduates, 2 Afghan coordinators, 2 Thunderbird for Good administrators, and 2 Academic Directors took off for a week of meetings, classes, and site visits on the east coast, hosted by the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://gucchd.georgetown.edu/76315.html\" target=\"_blank\">US/Afghan Women’s Council</a>&nbsp;and funded by the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www2.goldmansachs.com/citizenship/10000women/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Goldman Sachs Foundation</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The schedule was full, but filled with great meetings and valuable information, including classes on leadership and goal-setting taught by Georgetown University professors.&nbsp; On Monday November 1st there was a meeting of the US/Afghan Women’s Council focused on Entrepreneurship and chaired by the US Ambassador at Large for Global Women’s Issues, Melanne Verveer.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Artemis graduates emphasized a greater need for business training programs in Afghanistan – programs that could reach the underserved populations of the Provinces outside of Kabul especially.&nbsp; After the committee meeting there was a networking event in the historic old Georgetown library with some wonderful supporters of Afghan women in attendance: Diane Furstenburg, Caroline Firestone, Dina Powell, Mariam Nawabi, and Doris Buffet, just to name a few!&nbsp; I do know one thing, by the end of the evening; every attendee had at least one Project Artemis graduate’s business card in their pocket!</p>\r\n<p>On Election Day the ladies had a luncheon with the American Chamber of Commerce, and the Friends of the American University of Afghanistan.&nbsp; The group then went on to the Capital building for a special tour and a meeting with Robin Lerner, who staffs on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Mariana McGuire, who works with the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights, and Oversight.&nbsp; The ladies greatly appreciated the willingness of these ladies to take time out of their busy schedules to meet with them, and thoroughly enjoyed seeing the US Capital Building.&nbsp; After the Capital, the group joined the Washington DC alumni chapter for 1<span>st</span>&nbsp;Tuesday, Thunderbird style at One Washington Circle Hotel.</p>\r\n<p>On Wednesday a very successful meeting was held between the Artemis graduates and leaders of financial services institutions that are working in Afghanistan.&nbsp; The Artemis graduates were very interested in hearing about financing opportunities for their businesses and how those opportunities could best be accessed.&nbsp; In addition, there were staff from international organizations that assist local artisans in finding export markets for their goods from Afghanistan.</p>\r\n<p>In the afternoon, the ladies were privileged to be invited to the White House to attend a meeting hosted by the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/11/05/women-around-world-visit-white-house-0\" target=\"_blank\">White House Council on Women and Girls</a>, where such issues as the importance of women’s economic security, putting an end to corruption that hampers economic activity, and things that the US Government are doing to empower women and girls were all discussed.&nbsp; The meeting was hosted by Tina Tchen from the White House Council on Women and Girls, and attended by Abigail Friedman, the Director for Afghanistan from the National Security Council, Avra Siegel with the National Economic Council, and Ginger Lew, Senior Counselor to the White House National Economic Council and the Small Business Administration, as well as all 19 Artemis graduates, Thunderbird faculty and staff, and&nbsp;<em>10,000 Women</em>&nbsp;administrators from Goldman Sachs and the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.auaf.edu.af/\">American University of Afghanistan</a>.</p>\r\n<p>After saying farewell to the first half of the group to journey home to Afghanistan, the rest of us stayed on for two more days of meetings – starting with a trip to New York to report in to the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women program about the program, and to attend a luncheon hosted by the founder of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-11-05/goldman-sachs-10000-women-program-help-afghanistans-women-entrepreneurs-/\" target=\"_blank\">Daily Beast, Tina Brown</a>.&nbsp; On Friday, we all had a wonderful finish to the visit, attending a tea hosted at the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.embassyofafghanistan.org/EmbassyWelcomesAfghanWomenEntrepreneurs.html\" target=\"_blank\">Embassy of Afghanistan in Washington DC</a>&nbsp;before going out to the airport to bid our new Afghan friends goodbye.</p>\r\n<p>Inshallah, we will see them again, with successful businesses feeding an ever growing Afghan economy, creating jobs, and increasing peace through sustainable business.&nbsp; Until then, we at Thunderbird for Good would like to</p>"
