The meeting, hosted by Pamela Rager (T-bird '99), Executive Director of&nbsp;<em>10,000 Women</em>&nbsp;on the campus of the AUAF, focused on current and future economic opportunities for the graduates in Ghazni Province. Several of the women already have established businesses in Ghazni and Kabul with employee numbers ranging from a dozen to a thousand.</p>\r\n<p>Current businesses include fruit processing, tailoring, wool processing, construction, sericulture, and yogurt processing. The entrepreneurs discussed future business opportunities and various ways the PRT could support their endeavors. New business interests included cardboard manufacturing and aquaculture. The women identified access to training, land, and infrastructure as common limiting factors to business development and/or growth. The meeting was an exciting first step toward enhancing these entrepreneurs’ activities in Ghazni province and further meetings have been planned. Most importantly, these seven women represent a fraction of the 300 Afghan graduates of Goldman Sachs&nbsp;<em>10,000 Women</em>&nbsp;and there are many more motivated entrepreneurs across the country working hard to enrich Afghanistan's economy.</p>"
