Technoserve runs a well-respected entrepreneurship incubation/acceleration program and connected with our applied-learning team to retain a student consulting team to come to Santiago and document best practices in Chile, while simultaneously mapping all of Technoserve’s incubators/accelerators around the world and preparing best practices as a turn-key operations manual for any Technoserve incubator/accelerator. Students Ted Sordo, Andres Rebolledo, Emitt Bryant, Ashley Rhodes and Mohamed Elsuhimi share their experience in these blogs:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"/node/3373\">Relationships Make the Difference</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"/node/3368\">Cycles of Change in Santiago</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"/node/3364\">T-birds Land in Chile, Cachai?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"/node/3393\">One Week in Chile</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Yangon and Heho State, Myanmar</h4>\r\n<p>This project is another in a series of successful engagements with TEM Lab partner Winrock International. <a href=\"https://www.winrock.org/project/vcrd/\">In Myanmar, Winrock implements the USAID program “Value Chains for Rural Development”</a> and works with TEM Lab teams to support agribusinesses around the country to increase both internal capacity and create market linkages on the input and output side of the value chain. Heho Potato, the end client, is similar to many small and growing operations in Myanmar: the owner is capable and motivated but lacks the ability to delegate tasks to other parts of the organization. That is due to a lack of capacity in key roles, but also to a lack of awareness about <i>how</i> to formalize roles within a business so that it can grow. This is a classic SME problem. Students Brandan Bornfield, Tyler Stringham, and Brian Le share their experiences in these blogs:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"/node/3372\">The Great Transformation of Myanmar</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"/node/3386\">Southeast Asia’s Last Hidden Gem</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>Cluj-Napoca, Romania</h4>\r\n<p>As with Winrock in Myanmar,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ubbcluj.ro/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Babes-Bolyai University</a> (UBB) is another long-standing TEM Lab partnership. Thunderbird benefits from this relationship thanks to a longer-held ASU relationship with UBB, fostered by <a href=\"https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/74254\" target=\"_blank\">ASU Professor and the Honorary Consul of Romania in Arizona, Ileana Orlich</a>.&nbsp; Professor Orlich was recently<a href=\"https://asunow.asu.edu/20180829-asu-professor-receives-high-honor-romanian-president\"> honored by Romanian President Klaus Iohannis</a> for her work in promoting Romanian language and national identity abroad. The end client in Romania is <a href=\"http://servustech.com/\">ServUsTech</a>, a young technology company which is now targeting the “Internet of Things” as a growth pathway. This TEM Lab team created a strategy for ServUsTech to market its services, primarily to American clients, and made key personnel recommendations to align the company’s internal organization with the stated goals.
