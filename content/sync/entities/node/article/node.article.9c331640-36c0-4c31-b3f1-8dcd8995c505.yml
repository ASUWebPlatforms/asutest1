There is a need for up-and-coming leaders to take things into their own their hands by continuously upgrading their skills and talents and increasing what they offer their current or future employers in terms of what they bring to the job. The more you bring to the job, the higher your chances of moving upward in your career.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“I chose Thunderbird, an international business school, because I feel that the world is evolving and getting more connected every time, and getting a higher business education focused on the international environment is something that could help out boost my career.” --David Arismendy '17</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Reason #2: To change your career and do something different</h3>\r\n<p>Oftentimes the careers we chose while in college are not what we want or need as we grow older. Life changes, nothing remains the same, and stagnation is never a good thing when it comes to careers. It is easy to get stuck in a career, and become used to doing the same things over and over again. Pursuing a specialized Thunderbird graduate degree opens so many doors and broadens your perspective on what other career opportunities are out there--worldwide!</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“I decided to go to Thunderbird because I was at a turning point in my career and wanted to make a pivot away from a technical function to a more management type position.” --Belinda Chiu '17</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Reason #3: To discover your dream career and pursue it</h3>\r\n<p>While many realize they need to make a change in terms of their career path, they may not be sure which specific direction to go--even when it comes to business. Should they go more into marketing or are they best suited for consulting, what about finance and human resource management? With specialized, real-world curriculum at Thunderbird, you will get the opportunity to discover which path to take, and the skills to actually practice on a global scale.</p>\r\n<h3>Reason #4: To start your own business with international exposure and reach</h3>\r\n<p>If you are thinking of venturing out on your own, particularly if you hope that venture takes you around the world, Thunderbird is the place for you to acquire the skills you will need to excel at starting and growing your business from the ground up. In addition, you get the opportunity to network with faculty who have real-world experience in growing businesses and with other top-tier students from around the world, many of whom are professional and cultural experts who can guide you to the information and resources you need to get your business off the ground.</p>\r\n<h3>Reason #5: To enhance and cultivate your professional network</h3>\r\n<p>Networking is one of the most important keys to success in the global workforce. The age-old saying is true: It's not always what you know, but who you know. From day one at Thunderbird, students begin building their global network with their peers from around the world--and, they gain access to the vast Thunderbird alumni network of more than 40,000 global professionals in 150 countries worldwide. The Thunderbird network is so valuable, <strong><em>The Economist</em> ranks Thunderbird #3 for Potential to Network</strong>.</p>\r\n<h3>Reason #6: To experience a diverse learning environment</h3>\r\n<p>Studying at an international business school like Thunderbird gives you the opportunity to interact with students and faculty from all over the world. These global peers bring with their diverse experiences into the classroom and into team projects, enriching your learning and giving you the firsthand opportunity to discover the best ways to work in culturally diverse teams.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“All the classes I have taken at Thunderbird have been tough, but really exciting and helpful at the same time. I always thought of myself as an international person and these classes have helped me out even more by developing my thinking into a more global mindset. Analyzing scenarios in different countries, situations, and cultures are great exercises&nbsp;to grow my global mindset and be ready for the future.” --David Arismendy '17</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Reason #7: To develop leadership skills that work on a global scale</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In addition to studying with students from all over the world, Thunderbird students get countless opportunities to work with fellow students during class projects, in and outside of the class, developing the skills of not only communicating but also providing solutions to problems.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“Thunderbird was my opportunity to learn about working in teams, my own leadership style, and a sandbox to experiment in. So far, my experience of Thunderbird has been that. It's a melting pot of ideas and skills sets, and has helped me deepen my own self-awareness while encouraging me to be more flexible in the face of the unexpected.” --Belinda Chiu '17</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Reason #8: To study management from a 100% global perspective&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>At Thunderbird, every course is delivered through a global lens--teaching not just marketing, but global marketing. Not just strategy, but global strategy. Thunderbird is the only international business school that offers specialized graduate degrees that are provide you with the skills and mindset to do business anywhere in the world. At Thunderbird, there are courses on culture, international negotiations, and managing from a global perspective. Then there are specialized classes in Marketing, Finance, and consulting that teach students these disciplines but from an international angle, giving them more tools in working in an increasingly connected world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\"I wanted to learn more about specific regions and countries, to learn about how one should conduct business in those environments. Having an international background, I was aware that doing business in different regions required different skills and ways of thinking. I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of the different regions; hence, Thunderbird seemed like a good option.” --Saranya Seetharaman '17</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Reason #9: To study in a boutique grad school environment with smaller student/faculty ratio</h3>\r\n<p>With smaller sized classes, students get the most out of their education, making it easier for communication between students and faculty and among the students as they meet in groups. Moreover, many students learn better in smaller sized groups, with professors able to allocate more time for questions and learning.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">“With a small professor-to-cohort ratio, I find that the teaching is more personal, engaging and relevant, and this was what I wanted from a master’s education. Thunderbird was one of the few schools where the cohort was small enough to possibly achieve this, compared to bigger B schools that ... lose that sense of individual focus that I felt was crucial for maximum learning.” --Saranya Seetharaman '17</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Reason #10: To study abroad and to engage in applied learning</h3>\r\n<p>There are opportunities to study abroad while attending an international business school like Thunderbird School of Global Management. This gives students even more of an international experience to add to their knowledge and understanding of how to do business internationally. There are also opportunities for internships and <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/knowledge-network/the-rich-opportunities-the-consulting-labs-at-Thunderbird-provides\">short-term consulting assignments</a> that give students the chance to put into practice the new knowledge and skills they have acquired in class.</p>"
