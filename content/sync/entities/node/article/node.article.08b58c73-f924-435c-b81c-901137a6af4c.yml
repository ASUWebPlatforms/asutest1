The offer was attractive, Dr. Voris and the Board of Directors took time to weigh the pros and cons of such a move, eventually deciding against it.</p>\r\n<p>Though plans to move the campus were not realized, administrators continued to look for opportunities to make improvements and develop the vacant land.</p>\r\n<p>In a 1981 letter authored by Berger Erickson, long-time employee also known as “Mr. Thunderbird,” to G.R. Herberger (of the Herberger’s department store chain), Mr. Erickson discussed plans for various building projects, specifically a new faculty building. In the memo it casually states “...the estimated cost of which included the demolition of the tower…”. The Tower! One of the most sacred of buildings on the campus was almost arranged for demolition with the stroke of a key. This plan never came to fruition, there is no indication of why, but it reveals the mindset of the School’s administration that the original buildings may be sacrificed at any point for the growth and development of Thunderbird.</p>\r\n<p>In the archival history, we can find other instances of Thunderbird being courted to move to San Francisco and to Washington, DC, none of which seemed like suitable moves at the time. Over the years it seems like the School has maintained an openness to moving to different sites. While there has always been an appreciation for the history of the airfield, everyone seemed to acknowledge the temporary nature of the original structures and the need to seize the moment, if the right opportunity came along.</p>"
