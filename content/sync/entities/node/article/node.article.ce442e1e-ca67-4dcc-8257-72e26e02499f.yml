The center has thirteen different industries for its Enterprise Village with areas for practical application of the theoretical concepts and procedures behind the skills taught there. We were even able to meet some of the students while their classes were in session.</p>\r\n<p>One class quickly caught my attention: the design and textile class with 89 part-time students, mostly female, from all over Ekiti state in Western Nigeria. We arrived just in time for their \"practicals\".</p>\r\n<p>The days' assignment was to make tie dye fabrics.</p>\r\n<p>When people hear African fashion prints, patterns and blast of rich colors come to mind and unlike many myths about Africa, this one is true. The history of tie dye is deeply-rooted in African culture from the 1760’s and is a skill that has been passed down for generations. The locals have a name for it – adire. This process uses 100% cotton fabric to create uniquely patterned textile creations.</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"6768\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Fungai and Craig Batik in Nigeria\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Fungai and Crait Batik in Nigeria\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Fungai and Craig Batik in Nigeria\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Fungai and Crait Batik in Nigeria\"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Fungai and Craig Batik in Nigeria\",\"title\":\"Fungai and Crait Batik in Nigeria\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">Fungai and Craig Hard at Work</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>When the instructor told us about the challenges that the ladies face, what we enjoyed most about the conversation was how each issue had a solution mapped out by the ladies already. For example, plain 100% cotton is expensive and hard to come by. The students resolved this issue by figuring out how to make impressive designs using kente - a less expensive material pre-printed with patterns (yes, you can re-invent the wheel).&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-size: 1em;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: transparent; font-size: 1em;\">Another issue that the students had devised was an innovative solution for the market saturation of tie dye in the fashion industry. T</span>hese ladies thought to expand their target market from fashion to interior design. They created beautifully patterned, one-of-a-kind fabrics that could serve as wall hangings and coverings, tablecloths and runners, curtains, etc. in addition to clothing.</p>\r\n<p>From our discussions with the faculty and students, we realized that being female in Nigeria does not only mean oppression and struggle, but it means being innovative and fighting bravely against all odds.</p>\r\n<p>As the weeks of our project go on, we look forward to discovering what other skills we can learn from the Federal Polytechnic and, really, what to do with the trendy yard of material we made. We will continue to keep a close eye out for what else women in Ado-Ekiti are doing to break the norm.</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"6767\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab Nigeria Group Batik\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab Nigeria Group Batik\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab Nigeria Group Batik\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab Nigeria Group Batik\"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"TEM Lab Nigeria Group Batik\",\"title\":\"TEM Lab Nigeria Group Batik\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">Students and Finished Product</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>"
