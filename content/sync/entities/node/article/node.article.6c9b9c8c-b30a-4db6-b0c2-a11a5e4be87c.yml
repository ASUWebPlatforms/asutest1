As <a href=\"/node/140\">Professor Mansour Javidan </a>stated during Foundations, we are the black sheep, and we have found our home at Thunderbird. And inside that home, we have found our long-lost family. The newest additions to the Thunderbird family include people like Tyson Williams (<a href=\"/node/194\">Master of Global Management</a> '18) and Shay Woods (<a href=\"/node/190\">Master of Arts in Global Affairs &amp; Management</a> '19).</p>\r\n<p>While Tyson Williams currently has his eye on several companies, his long-term goal is to be involved in the business development of a renewable energy company to build power infrastructures in developing countries. When asked why he decided to attend Thunderbird for his graduate program, he responded:</p>\r\n<p>\"I first learned of Thunderbird through a professor that taught during my undergrad. At that point, however, my career wasn’t focused on business. It wasn’t until about five years later that I reconnected with a military friend that was going to Thunderbird, and after meeting his classmates and friends, I was astounded by the diversity and wealth of knowledge. Around that same time, I was facing an important decision to change my career. I decided to research Thunderbird, and after visiting for a <a href=\"/node/2402\">Preview Day</a> I knew this was the right school for me.\"</p>\r\n<h3><a href=\"http://dastornews.com/2017/11/the-next-generation-of-the-thunderbird-family-of-misfits/\">Read the rest of the story...</a></h3>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;[[{\"fid\":\"7957\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Das Tor, Thunderbird Student Newspaper\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Das Tor, Thunderbird Student Newspaper\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Das Tor, Thunderbird Student Newspaper\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"Das Tor, Thunderbird Student Newspaper\"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Das Tor, Thunderbird Student Newspaper\",\"title\":\"Das Tor, Thunderbird Student Newspaper\",\"style\":\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]</h3>"
