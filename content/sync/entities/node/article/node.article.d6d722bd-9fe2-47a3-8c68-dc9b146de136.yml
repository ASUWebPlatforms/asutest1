    value: '<p>As we move further into the&nbsp;Fourth Industrial Revolution, demand for some jobs is increasing while demand for others is decreasing. This trend is concerning to many business owners and economists who worry about future job stability. However, experts across the spectrum from fintech to supply chain believe that while many jobs will be displaced, even more new jobs will be created.</p><p>In its 2018&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/the-future-of-jobs-report-2018"><i>Future of Jobs Report</i>,</a>&nbsp;The World Economic Forum (WEF) forecasted&nbsp;the&nbsp;displacement of 75 million jobs and the&nbsp;creation of 133 million new jobs worldwide from 2018 through 2022. It’s a phenomenon referred to as ‘job churn’ and it reflects the changing work requirements of our modern world. We are seeing increasing opportunities in emerging technology with new roles in data analytics and AI, engineering and cloud computing. We''re also seeing the continuing expansion of services and human-centric roles – including industries like healthcare and functions such as human resources.&nbsp;</p><h3>Booming Sectors and Industries in the U.S. &nbsp;</h3><p>According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/industries-fast-grow-decline-employment.htm">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS),</a>&nbsp;employment is projected to grow by 6 million jobs by 2029. The&nbsp;fastest gains will be seen in the sectors and&nbsp;industries listed below. These BLS data only represent what is happening in the U.S. Other countries will look different based on many factors such as their level of development and the varying specialization of the country.&nbsp;</p><h4>Healthcare and Social Assistance&nbsp;</h4><p>Healthcare in the U.S. is projected to see the most growth&nbsp;over the next&nbsp;decade. The&nbsp;healthcare and&nbsp;social assistance sectors should add a collective 2.07 million jobs. According to the BLS, "Factors that are expected to contribute to the large increase include increased demand to care&nbsp;for the aging baby-boom population, longer life expectancies and continued growth in the number of patients with chronic conditions."&nbsp;</p><p><strong><i>Fastest Growing Industries within Healthcare and&nbsp;Social Assistance</i></strong></p><ul><li><i>Individual and family services:&nbsp;</i>1.05 million jobs&nbsp;created</li><li><i>Home healthcare services:&nbsp;</i>456,000&nbsp;jobs&nbsp;created</li><li><i>Outpatient care services:&nbsp;</i>276,700&nbsp;jobs&nbsp;created</li><li><i>Health practitioners:&nbsp;</i>239,000&nbsp;jobs&nbsp;created</li><li><i>Other ambulatory healthcare services:&nbsp;</i>53,300&nbsp;jobs&nbsp;created&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>Professional and Business Services</h4><p>The Professional and&nbsp;Business Services&nbsp;sector&nbsp;is the second-fastest-growing sector in the U.S. It is expected to see an increase of over 1 million jobs across the following industries:</p><p><strong><i>Fastest Growing Professions within&nbsp;Professional and Business Services&nbsp;</i></strong></p><ul><li><i>Computer systems design and related services:&nbsp;</i>574,500&nbsp;jobs&nbsp;created</li><li><i>Management, scientific, and technical consulting services</i>: 334,200 jobs created&nbsp;</li><li><i>Office administrative services:</i>&nbsp;98,700 jobs created&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>Other Services&nbsp;</h4><p>The Other Services category is comprised of services that don''t fall&nbsp;into any other main sector. It is growing at a healthy pace. In the next&nbsp;decade, this sector should&nbsp;add almost 230,000 jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong><i>Fastest Growing Industries within&nbsp;Other Services&nbsp;</i></strong></p><ul><li><i>Grantmaking and giving services and social advocacy organizations:&nbsp;</i>99,400&nbsp;jobs&nbsp;created</li><li><i>Other personal services:&nbsp;</i>97,100&nbsp;jobs&nbsp;created</li><li><i>Commercial and industrial machinery and equipment (except automotive and electronic) repair and maintenance:&nbsp;</i>33,300 jobs created&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>Transportation and Warehousing&nbsp;</h4><p>The Transportation and Warehousing sector is expected to see a 1.4% annual rate of change through 2029, adding just over 126,000 jobs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><i>Fastest Growing Industry within&nbsp;Transportation and Warehousing</i>&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><i>Couriers and messengers:&nbsp;</i>126,300&nbsp;jobs&nbsp;created</li></ul><h4>Mining&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4><p>Mining is part of the natural resources and mining supersector. Many mining industries – like Coal Mining – are supposed to experience a rapid decrease in jobs while other extractive industries should experience&nbsp;rapid growth.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><i>Fastest Growing Industries within Mining&nbsp;</i></strong></p><ul><li><i>Support activities for mining:&nbsp;</i>111,100 jobs&nbsp;created</li><li><i>Metal ore mining</i>: 6,800&nbsp;jobs&nbsp;created&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>Information&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4><p>Information is an important sector in the U.S. According to the data from the BLS, we should see a compound annual rate of change of about 1.9% over the next decade, specifically in software publishing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><i>Fastest Growing Industry within Information</i></strong></p><ul><li><i>Software publishing:&nbsp;</i>94,300&nbsp;jobs&nbsp;created</li></ul><h4>Leisure and Hospitality&nbsp;</h4><p>Leisure and hospitality are expected to grow at a healthy rate through 2029, adding just over 40,000 jobs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><i>Fastest Growing Industries within Leisure and Hospitality&nbsp;</i></strong></p><ul><li><i>Museums, historical sites, and similar institutions:&nbsp;</i>29,800&nbsp;jobs&nbsp;created</li><li><i>Independent artists, writers, and performers:&nbsp;</i>11,000&nbsp;jobs&nbsp;created&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>Manufacturing</h4><p>Overall, manufacturing in the U.S. is expected to see a dramatic decline in the coming years. In fact, it''s expected to lose about 444,800 jobs. This is mostly due to advancements in technology and the outsourcing of manufacturing to other countries. However, there is one area of manufacturing in the U.S. that is expected to see employment growth.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><i>Fastest Growing Industry within Manufacturing&nbsp;</i></strong></p><ul><li><i>Animal food manufacturing:&nbsp;</i>10,800&nbsp;jobs&nbsp;created</li></ul><h4>&nbsp;Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting &nbsp;</h4><p>While this sector as a whole isn''t necessarily booming, it is rated as the fastest growing industry with the highest compound annual change of 3.7%, specifically in forestry. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong><i>Fastest Growing Industry within&nbsp;Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting&nbsp;</i></strong></p><ul><li><i>Forestry:&nbsp;</i>3,500&nbsp;jobs&nbsp;created</li></ul><p>Some of these sectors, such as manufacturing, are seeing significant job churn, while other sectors are not. So, while it''s important to know&nbsp;which sectors and industries hold the most promise in the next ten years, it is just as important to understand which jobs and skills will be most in demand.&nbsp;</p><h3>The&nbsp;Jobs and Skills of Tomorrow in 20 Major Economies&nbsp;</h3><p>In 2020,&nbsp;the World Economic Forum&nbsp;published&nbsp;<a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Jobs_of_Tomorrow_2020.pdf">research</a>&nbsp;from LinkedIn that&nbsp;analyzed&nbsp;the most in-demand careers over the previous five years to predict areas of future expansion. The data came from 20 major economies and analysts found that there are five clusters of professions emerging between 2018 and 2022: Data and AI, Engineering and Cloud Computing, People and Culture, Product Development and Sales, Marketing and Content.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the report contains research from Burning Glass Technologies that identified strong employment growth in two other clusters in the U.S.: Green Economy jobs and Care Economy jobs.&nbsp;The WEF report compiled the data from LinkedIn and Burning Glass and&nbsp;also mapped out the skills most in demand for each of these clusters. According to the research, these skills span five distinct clusters:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Business skills (B)</strong> -&nbsp;The capabilities needed to start and run a business</li><li><strong>Specialized industry skills (I)</strong> -&nbsp;Competencies that are specific to a particular industry</li><li><strong>General and soft skills (G/S)</strong> -&nbsp;Skills needed in any field, such as communication, leadership and problem-solving</li><li><strong>Tech baseline skills (TB)</strong> -&nbsp;Capabilities that span from general computer literacy to more specialized apps and programs</li><li><strong>Tech disruptive skills (TD)</strong> -&nbsp;The ability to use and develop technologies that will have a significant impact for years to come</li></ul><p>Below is a list of the profession clusters ranked by their growth rate, and the top five skills for each.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1.
