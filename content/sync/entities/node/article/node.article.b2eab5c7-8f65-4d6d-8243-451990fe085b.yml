Waiting&nbsp;would be a big mistake. You can’t just submit a&nbsp;résumé&nbsp;and think your work is done. Being proactive&nbsp;by following up&nbsp;is key, and now there’s research to&nbsp;back this up.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>I spoke to Michael Steinitz, executive director of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.roberthalf.com/work-with-us/our-services/accountemps\">Accountemps</a>, and he is a big believer in reaching out to potential employers after sending in your application.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>In an&nbsp;Accountemps&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.roberthalf.com/blog/job-interview-tips/hello-its-me-again?utm_campaign=Press_Release&amp;utm_medium=Link&amp;utm_source=Press_Release\">survey</a>&nbsp;of human resources managers, 100 percent of respondents said&nbsp;job seekers&nbsp;should&nbsp;check in&nbsp;after submitting a&nbsp;résumé. Let’s&nbsp;put it&nbsp;another way: 0 percent thought following up was a bad idea.<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>There’s no excuse not to touch base.&nbsp;Doing so&nbsp;demonstrates&nbsp;you’re&nbsp;highly&nbsp;interested in the&nbsp;position. It&nbsp;also&nbsp;shows off your&nbsp;energy, perseverance and professionalism&nbsp;–&nbsp;virtues&nbsp;a&nbsp;manager loves&nbsp;to see in potential employees.&nbsp;They know that candidates&nbsp;who display initiative during the recruiting process are likely to bring that quality to their work as well.<img src=\"https://www.danamanciagli.com/DiviWP/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/man-waiting-by-phone-300x200.jpg\" style=\"margin: 10px; float: right;\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-8590 alignright\"></p>\r\n<p>Think of it this way:&nbsp;Who wants to hire&nbsp;someone&nbsp;who sits&nbsp;back and expects&nbsp;things to come to them?&nbsp;You&nbsp;have to&nbsp;put yourself firmly in the hiring manager’s line of sight as someone&nbsp;who’s&nbsp;enthusiastic&nbsp;and on the ball.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>But the devil’s in the details. Here is&nbsp;Michael’s advice about&nbsp;how to go about following up:<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 1em; background-color: transparent;\"><strong>HOW.</strong>&nbsp;Of the managers interviewed, 64 percent prefer to receive&nbsp;a&nbsp;follow-up&nbsp;via email. This form of communication allows recipients to easily respond&nbsp;and&nbsp;is not an imposition on their time. The next most&nbsp;popular method&nbsp;among hiring managers&nbsp;is a phone call&nbsp;(21 percent), while&nbsp;only 14 percent like in-person follow-ups.&nbsp;Whatever you do, don’t text hiring managers&nbsp;–&nbsp;even if you somehow&nbsp;find&nbsp;their mobile number. And&nbsp;please&nbsp;don’t reach out via social media.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\" data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}\">&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 1em; background-color: transparent;\"><strong>WHEN.</strong>&nbsp;Following up is&nbsp;great. Pestering is not.&nbsp;Don’t&nbsp;contact them&nbsp;the very next day. Give them enough time to read&nbsp;your&nbsp;résumé&nbsp;and evaluate your skillset against that of your competition.&nbsp;But do&nbsp;follow up before the application window closes and your&nbsp;résumé&nbsp;is&nbsp;forgotten.&nbsp;What’s the sweet spot?&nbsp;Of the managers surveyed, 35 percent said one&nbsp;to&nbsp;two weeks after submitting a&nbsp;résumé, while 29 percent&nbsp;think&nbsp;less than&nbsp;a&nbsp;week&nbsp;is good.</span><span style=\"font-size: 1em;\" data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559685&quot;:360}\">&nbsp;</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>“Many job seekers are too ‘nice’,” Steinitz said. “They don’t want to&nbsp;come across&nbsp;as&nbsp;being&nbsp;pushy, so they wait&nbsp;–&nbsp;and wait.&nbsp;Hiring managers are busy. Just because you don’t hear back from them doesn’t mean they’re not interested. Following up is an excellent way to add a personal touch to your application and stand out.”<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>But there’s&nbsp;no need for extravagant tactics.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>“A quick email should do it,”&nbsp;he said.&nbsp;“After about a week, reiterate your interest with a courteous and concise&nbsp;message. Also ask about the next steps. The important thing is to not miss out on&nbsp;the next&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;make a good impression.”<span data-ccp-props=\"{}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Don’t settle for being just another&nbsp;anonymous&nbsp;résumé&nbsp;in a pile. Call attention to your enthusiasm and&nbsp;corporate fit with a&nbsp;follow-up email, and go get that job.</p>\r\n<p>Join Dana Manciagli’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://danamanciagl.samcart.com/referral/ihc4Zdak/mHDAKfwajfZgTWDa\">Job Search Master Class</a>&nbsp;<em>right now</em>&nbsp;and immediately access the most comprehensive job search system currently available!</p>\r\n<p><em>Thunderbird School of Global Management Alumna Dana Manciagli '84 is the author of \"Cut the crap, Get a job\".
