In terms of culture, of course, but also in terms of undergraduate degrees; people with lots of experience or little-to-no experience. But everyone had worked at some point in their life. We all had different ways of thinking, and you saw that in the classroom discussions or group projects. That’s better than thinking in just one direction.

But learning took on a different shape with the 'collaborate to graduate’ model – meaning students cheered each other on in coursework, shared notes about their hometowns and home countries, and even traveled to visit families for holidays… “Having that firsthand experience, it was life-changing honestly,” she said, adding, “People here were just really willing to teach, to learn, to grow together. It was competitive, but a good competition. People were willing to help each other and genuinely wanted to see each other succeed.”</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/228997978\">Watch Nancy's video</a> | <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/about/news-events/international-student-finds-home-thunderbird-school\">Read Nancy’s story</a></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>“People here are just really willing to teach, to learn, to grow together.

But people helped and collaborated in every aspect so all of us grew as a ‘we.’ ” Juan Carlos&nbsp;credits his fellow T-birds for helping expand and open his own mind. “You interact with people from all over the world, whether you’re in class or out of class. It was beautiful, because you learn from so many cultures 24/7.” That cultural awareness and global focus can translate into business success.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/229919271\">Watch Juan Carlos's video</a> | <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/about/news-events/thunderbird-bolivia-student-seizes-opportunities-succeed-and-give-back\">Read Juan Carlos’s story</a></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>“We all are somehow immersed in globalization … when we eat, when we buy, when we do business, we are all exposed to it.” – <em><a href=\"https://ctt.ec/c5mT3\">Click to tweet</a></em><a href=\"#_msocom_1\" id=\"_anchor_1\" name=\"_msoanchor_1\"><br></a></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h4>Join the discussion!</h4>\r\n<p>Have you participated in peer-to-peer learning?
