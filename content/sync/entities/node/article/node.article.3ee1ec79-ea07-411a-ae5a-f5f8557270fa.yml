    value: "<p>The way we work is changing. We’re saying goodbye to the 9 to 5 grind, instead opting for flexibility to work whenever and wherever we’d like. In 2016,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/us/remote-workers-work-from-home.html\">43 percent of employed Americans</a>&nbsp;said they spent at least some time working remotely—that’s a 4 percent increase from 2012. As remote work becomes more popular, a new trend has emerged. Digital nomads, employed adults travelling while working,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/03/business/digital-nomads-work-tourism.html?_r=0\">are taking remote work to the next level</a>.</p>\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"6633\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"millennial career\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"millennial career\"},\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"millennial career\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"millennial career\"}},\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"millennial career\",\"title\":\"millennial career\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]</p>\r\n<p>According to a recent study from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hostelworld.com/\">Hostelworld</a>, the world’s largest hostel booking platform sparking social experiences across the globe, the digital nomad tribe is growing, and for good reason. Hostelworld’s study found that 71 percent of US citizens report that they are equally as productive or more productive when working remotely. What’s more, nearly 70 percent who have worked remotely while travelling said they were just as productive if not more productive during that time period. That’s good news for travellers who want to meet the world without sacrificing their career.</p>\r\n<p>I sat down with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ottokar/?ppe=1\">Otto Rosenberger</a>, travel expert and CMO of Hostelworld, to discuss why working professionals should consider the digital nomad life. Here’s what he had to say:</p>\r\n<h2><span>Travel the globe without sacrificing your career</span></h2>\r\n<p>Beyond working from the comfort of your living room, this newfound flexibility in the workforce offers a unique opportunity to travel the globe —&nbsp;exploring new places, engaging with new cultures and beyond —&nbsp;without sacrificing your career. A whopping 62 percent of US citizens would consider working remotely while travelling abroad if their company would support it. Whether you’re interested in spending a month abroad or a year committed to a program like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://remoteyear.com/how-it-works/\">Remote Year</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hackerparadise.org/\">Hacker Paradise</a>, the first step is discussing these opportunities with your company.</p>\r\n<h2><span>It’s never too late to join this tribe of nomads</span></h2>\r\n<p>There’s no doubt that millennials are driving the digital nomad movement. That said, it’s never too late to join the tribe. In fact, it’s older generations that are most interested in applying to formal programs that support remote work while travelling (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nomadlist.com/\">Nomad List</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.remoteyear.com/?utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=CPC&amp;utm_campaign=Branded%20Search&amp;utm_term=Remote%20Year&amp;gclid=CN6btKvN3tQCFZyNswodwBEESw\">Remote Year</a>and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hackerparadise.org/\">Hacker Paradise</a>). Those between the age of 45 and 49 are 2 times more likely to express interest in a remote work program.</p>\r\n<h2><span>Boundless personal and professional benefits</span></h2>\r\n<p>There’s more to travel than rest and relaxation. US citizens who have worked remotely while travelling abroad report a number of benefits including the ability to work and explore a new place, develop personally and professionally, learn about a new culture and meet new people.</p>\r\n<h2><span>Increase your employability</span></h2>\r\n<p>What’s more, travel experiences can give you a leg up on the competition when searching for a new job. Integrating travel into your daily routine gives you the opportunity to build a richer resume that shows off critical skills like communication, confidence and beyond. We’ve found that 73 percent of those that bring up travel experiences during the interview process report that it had a positive impact on the recruiter’s decision.</p>\r\n<p>Wow, after speaking to Otto, I’m thinking about becoming a Digital nomad myself! Even if we don’t go this far in our remote working habits, it certainly challenges the old-fashioned out-of-office message that says “I’m out of the country on business and won’t be able to respond to your e-mail until next week”.&nbsp; Where there is bandwidth, we can be connected.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span>Join Dana Manciagli’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://danamanciagl.samcart.com/referral/ihc4Zdak/mHDAKfwajfZgTWDa\">Job Search Master Class</a>&nbsp;<em>right now</em>&nbsp;and immediately access the most comprehensive job search system currently available!</span></p>\r\n<p><em>Thunderbird School of Global Management Alumna Dana Manciagli '84 is the author of \"Cut the crap, Get a job\".
