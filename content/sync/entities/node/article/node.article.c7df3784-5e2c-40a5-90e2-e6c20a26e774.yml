One of the reasons might have to do with how the TSG views the events they organize and the steps they have taken to ensuring better organized events. Vishal Bhardwaj (MGM ’17), the current TSG President, explained that the TSG team made a commitment that as a team they would help and support all initiatives. This was emphasized in every meeting that all TSG members were required to attend events, and as Vishal said, “I found that TSG members were also aligned with the idea of supporting each other’s initiative.”</span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://dastornews.com/2017/11/thundercares-representing-the-best-of-thunderbird/\">Read more...</a></p>"
