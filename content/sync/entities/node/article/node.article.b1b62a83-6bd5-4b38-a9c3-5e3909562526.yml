    value: '<p>Innovation is a key strategic priority for many global organizations and executives. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/how-we-help-clients/growth-and-innovation#">McKinsey</a>, 84% of executives believe innovation is important for growth. Sadly, only 6% of these executives are satisfied with their performance in innovating. One massive roadblock between wanting to achieve breakthroughs and actually being innovative is having an innovation management strategy for growth.</p><p>When an organization has an idea for new technology or a solution capable of prototyping, it may be tempting to run full speed ahead without thinking too much about the details. However, it''s imperative to take a step back and ask, "How do we get there?" Organizations that fail to break through or keep up often fall short in developing a core business strategy for creating new products or services, then bringing them to existing or new markets while working within its overall business plan, mission and vision. These non-innovators don''t plan and execute a strategic action plan to scale their operations through systematic creative breakthroughs. They need a grand strategy for growth driven by new ideas, new approaches, new business models.</p><h3><strong>What is an Innovation Growth Strategy and&nbsp;Why Do&nbsp;Organizations Need One?&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>A strategy for growing by innovating is a business model innovation roadmap that guides enterprises toward their goals. It helps companies, nonprofits, and government agencies strategically expand their operations by introducing new tools and processes systematically as part of their cultures.

To prevent silos, the strategy must also take into account each unit and internal stakeholder<span class="ILfuVd">—</span>marketing, sales, research and development, and IT, for example.</p><p>Start-ups, global corporations, and governments alike can benefit from having an innovation strategy in place. Here are just a few benefits the group may realize:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Clear Priorities and Goals -</strong>&nbsp;An innovation strategy geared toward growth clearly states objectives and goals with the steps necessary to achieve them.

The resulting innovation model will become part of your value proposition for hiring and employee retention.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Alignment Across the Organization -</strong>&nbsp;When a supergroup that spans disciplines is working toward common goals, leaders create alignment. Different teams have different responsibilities and strategies, but they all share the same commitment to continuous improvement through creativity.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Overcome Challenges -</strong>&nbsp;When those inevitable challenges arise, there''s a long-term resource in place for testing new ideas aimed at overcoming the issues and staying on track.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Increased Productivity and Performance -</strong>&nbsp;When you have an innovative, aligned company culture, employees are generally motivated to work more efficiently. By rewarding greater initiative, executives and managers give the workforce a vested interest in the success and well-being of the enterprise or institution.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Growth Culture -</strong>&nbsp;An innovative culture encourages employees at all levels to have a growth mindset<span class="ILfuVd">—</span>the belief that success can be achieved with time, creativity, and energy, not just varying abilities and specializations.
