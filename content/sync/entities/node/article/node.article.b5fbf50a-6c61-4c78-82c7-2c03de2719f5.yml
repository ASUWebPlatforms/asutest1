The blog documents Lima's journey as an Afghan businesswoman. She currently is a full-time student at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bucknell.edu/\">Bucknell Univeristy</a>&nbsp;in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>By Lima Ahmad (Omiad)</strong></p>\r\n<p>It is November 2006. I am so tired just arrived at Phoenix Arizona airport, after two and half days on the way. It is the morning of my first day of Project Artemis. I am going towards my class where everyone is waiting that how the program will start and what we will be doing during these two weeks. I looked around Thunderbird Campus and wondered how lucky the students of this university would be studying here.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the 2006 Artemis program started, with the welcome speeches by President of Thunderbird University and Artemis program organizers. The two weeks journey continued with classes, fun, classes,&nbsp; visits and again classes, some fighting among the women participants, homecoming function, Grand Canyon, classes, mentors, fun talk, jokes, visiting businesses, shopping shopping! Yeey! Gym, haircut, classes, waking up daily at 6:00am, meeting MBA students, classes, graduation ceremony, meeting Afghanistan Ambassador, classes, interviewed by TV channels. Oh gosh! I want to go home, I feel tired at the end of two weeks.</p>\r\n<p>Yeeey it is 18th of Nov, 2006. I am on the way to airport going back to home.&nbsp;<img src=\"http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1283981199g\" alt=\":)\">&nbsp;But! What am I taking back with me from Artemis program? Let me calculate as the airport is much far from the school. I can point out some of them till I get to airport. I have the chance to know 15 experienced Afghan businesswomen from whom I can learn a lot, and their connection and knowledge will help me a lot expending my business. I have learned so many new ways of carrying out my business, and the most important thing that I have learned from visiting different businesses in Arizona is that all of those businesses have started from nothing, and their passion and commitment towards their business ideas have made them so successful. I have met the wonderful faculties and management of Thunderbird that they have taught me how to be a professional businesswoman, and yeah I have a mentor which I am not sure how I will be communicating during my 2 years commitment to her but she seems so nice&nbsp;<img src=\"http://s2.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif?m=1283981199g\" alt=\":)\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>This is how it was! My experience in Project Artemis.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Now it is 2010 I remember each moment of it as it was just a month ago. Normally we do not think about how much we have changed and improved in regular basis, but when I look at couple of years back, I realized I have achieved a lot. The two weeks of Artemis program, might seem sometimes overwhelming and sometimes fun, and sometimes tiring. And it also depends on how we want to perceive it. It can be a two weeks beautiful picnic and it can be a life changing opportunity. It has changed my life completely! It gave me the vision what I want to be, and how I can add value to my business and how can I be more useful to other businesses in my country.</p>\r\n<p>I am going back to Thunderbird School of Global Management again to attend Project Artemis 2010 for a short period. But this is not what just happened. A stanza of a poem by Robert Desnos fits well here which says “<em>I have dreamed of you so much, have walked so much, talked so much, slept so much with your phantom, that perhaps the only thing left for me is to become a phantom among phantoms…”</em></p>\r\n<p><em></em>Here I tend to say that it is not just an incident or a chance that I am going there; I have really worked hard for it. And only my hard work would not have made me successful without your help.</p>\r\n<p>Your Help! “You” The Women of Afghanistan! Yes the most valuable thing I took back with me was the network of Afghan women. I have learned so much from you since last 4 years. I have learned how you overcome challenges during the crisis in the business. I have learned from you how to learn from the mistakes visiting your businesses, and I have learned how to teach about business techniques and marketing strategies studying the needs of your businesses and working on your business ideas with you. In part I have learned how to be united with you looking at cultural, racial and gender oppression that you face.</p>\r\n<p>Being involved with you for four years made me a responsible business woman and a responsible citizen to my people. Thus, my aim of coming to Artemis 2010 is to share my experiences with you that this two weeks program is not the only chance you can learn, perhaps this is the starting point. The actual learning will start when you all go back to Afghanistan and start working with each other. Use the resources and opportunities that Artemis program is opening for you but more importantly work united, because it is believed that women do not have “so called history” because they are not united. I truly believe that we can make history, and can change the economic situation of Afghanistan.</p>"
