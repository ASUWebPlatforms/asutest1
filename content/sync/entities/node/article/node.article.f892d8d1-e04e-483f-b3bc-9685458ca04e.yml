Mentors can be both men and women.&nbsp; They need just two hours a month and a passion for supporting a woman entrepreneur.&nbsp; Over the course of a year, you’ll meet with your mentee online two hours a month to work on goals that are tailored to her needs and your expertise and interests.&nbsp; There are participants from diverse sectors and on board, so chances are there is a mentee who could benefit from your expertise and background.</p>\r\n<p>From rejuvenating interest in your own work, using your business skills in a new way, joining a vibrant community of accomplished entrepreneurs and professionals, making new contacts and supporting your mentee as she makes inimitable strides, mentoring presents a tremendous learning and growth opportunity.&nbsp; The next group will start in May.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Go&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cherieblairfoundation.org/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>&nbsp;to hear directly from mentees and mentors about their experiences and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cherieblairfoundation.org/mentoring-get-involved/\" target=\"_blank\">apply</a>&nbsp;by March 31, 2015 to take advantage of this opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"2977\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Mentoring Women in Business Programme\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false},\"type\":\"media\",\"link_text\":null,\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Mentoring Women in Business Programme\",\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\"}}]]</p>"
