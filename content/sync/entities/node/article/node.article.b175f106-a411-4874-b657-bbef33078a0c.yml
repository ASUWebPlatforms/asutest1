    value: "<p>The book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Family-Business-Ernesto-J-Poza/dp/1285056825/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1375226746&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=family+business+ernesto+poza\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Family Business</em></a> points to 13 governance pitfalls that can derail family businesses before the baton passes to the second or third generation. Successful organizations must develop strategies to navigate the following challenges:</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Nepotism:&nbsp;</strong>A family-first attitude in selecting managers and employees can take a toll on any family enterprise that falls into this trap. When last name and not merit drive the hiring process, morale and professionalism suffer.<br><strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Loss of family identity and values:&nbsp;</strong>Family values, family legacy and the renewed sense of purpose brought on by a multigenerational family vision are the anchors of an enterprising family’s continuity plan. But these often erode as families grow in numbers and wealth.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Family conflicts:&nbsp;</strong>Speed is a competitive advantage inherent in family firms due to the overlap between ownership and management. But in later generations, a family mired in conflict can lose its nimbleness.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Belief that fair means equal:</strong>&nbsp;Parents love all their children equally (or at least they try). Unfortunately, an emphasis on equality can lead well-meaning founders to transfer successful businesses to siblings who are unprepared to govern. Wiser parents understand that not all children want the same things for their future.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Unwillingness to let go:&nbsp;</strong>Family business CEOs tend to stay in office much longer than their counterparts at nonfamily businesses. Although sometimes an advantage, this can create problems when a family CEOs grows out of touch with market changes.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6. Entitlement culture:</strong>&nbsp;Another challenge from wealth and enterprise to multigenerational families is the rise of an entitlement culture, an unsustainable culture of acquisition and consumption.</p>\r\n<p><strong>7. Dilution of wealth:&nbsp;</strong>Besides the erosion that may result from the entitlement culture and taxes, distributions and the breakup of the business can limit a family’s access to capital for investments and acquisitions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>8. Erosion of entrepreneurism:</strong>&nbsp;Increased bureaucracy and regulations can mean more meetings, more memos and less risk-taking as family businesses grow.</p>\r\n<p><strong>9. Insufficient professionalism:</strong>&nbsp;No family has a monopoly on the knowledge and skills needed to run a successful business. Thus, family firms must work to grow the professionalism of their family employees while also recruiting nonfamily talent.</p>\r\n<p><strong>10. Lack of transparency:</strong>&nbsp;Many family firms resist the call for greater transparency, which can put investors, boards of directors and professional managers at a disadvantage.</p>\r\n<p><strong>11. Lack of oversight:&nbsp;</strong>Complacency, resistance to change and other problems can result when family firms fail to establish independent boards and other governance structures.</p>\r\n<p><strong>12. Lack of boundaries:</strong>&nbsp;Family business must maintain proper balance between the family, the ownership and the management. Infractions across boundaries can erode a professional culture.</p>\r\n<p><strong>13. Altruism:&nbsp;</strong>Family members look out for each other. But this tendency can lead to decisions that are economically irrational.</p>"
