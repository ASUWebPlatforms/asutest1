    value: "<p>There may be nothing harder than walking into the boss’ office to ask for a raise.&nbsp;But budget cuts are a way of life and in many companies if you don’t ask for a raise – you don’t get one. It’s not impossible with a little prep work and a shot of confidence.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>I sat down with empowerment speaker Kelly McNelis,&nbsp;founder of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://womenforone.com/\">Women&nbsp;For&nbsp;One</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;author of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://womenforone.com/messy-brilliance-book/\">Your Messy Brilliance</a>, for&nbsp;a few&nbsp;simple tips to get what you want.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3>Why is it so hard&nbsp;for so many of us&nbsp;to ask for a raise?<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>We aren’t taught to talk about money,&nbsp;especially women,&nbsp;but we need to acknowledge what we are bringing to the table and ask for what we are worth. Having this hard conversation starts with yourself. When you&nbsp;get clear&nbsp;in your own mind&nbsp;about what you want and why you want it,&nbsp;you’ll be better positioned to talk about money and negotiate with your boss without wavering.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3>How can&nbsp;we get comfortable talking about money?<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>Talking about money is taboo in our society, so&nbsp;you have to be your own best advocate. Start with people you trust like close friends and family&nbsp;and ask them how they&nbsp;did it. Also, research salaries in your industry and in your area&nbsp;so you understand the range (<a href=\"http://salary.com/\">salary.com</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://payscale.com/\">payscale.com</a>&nbsp;are good resources). If it feels appropriate, ask colleagues how much they make.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3>Do we need to have a big win before we ask for a raise?<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>It’s great to have a big accomplishment, but not always necessary. Make a list of your achievements&nbsp;over the past year&nbsp;and take credit for ideas you contributed&nbsp;to your team. You need to be willing to share your accomplishments in a&nbsp;logical&nbsp;way, so think about how your work helped the company’s bottom line.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3>What if a person doesn’t feel comfortable&nbsp;boasting?&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>Don’t wait until you want to ask for a raise to start taking credit for your work, because if you don’t – someone else will. Celebrate little&nbsp;accomplishments&nbsp;as they come up so the boss hears about all your hard work throughout the year.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>You&nbsp;can&nbsp;also explain how your accomplishments benefit&nbsp;the whole team&nbsp;by connecting&nbsp;your successes to the company’s overall goals. Communicate how you have helped uplift your company’s&nbsp;vision,&nbsp;as well as the people around you.&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3>Hard conversations with the boss can be intimidating! What’s the secret?<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>Asking for a raise might be one of the most intimidating things imaginable, but&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/conquering-fear-to-step-into-your-true-purpose-realize-your-potential\">instead&nbsp;of being afraid</a>, consider this a&nbsp;win-win for everyone. Knowing that you&nbsp;worked hard to earn that raise&nbsp;will help you&nbsp;find&nbsp;confidence. Knowing that your boss appreciates you will inspire you to do even more for the company!<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3>Should we throw out a number?<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>Have a specific number in mind and be unapologetic about naming it when you ask for your raise. The value of matter-of-fact transparency is that it makes you a better and more assertive communicator who doesn’t leave money on the table!&nbsp;<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3>What&nbsp;if I think my boss doesn’t like me?<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<p>Assume that your boss&nbsp;<span>wants</span>&nbsp;to support you – and be willing to give them ideas on how they can do so. Just asking for the raise will make your boss look at you differently and&nbsp;re-energize the enthusiasm that you have for your job. If your boss says no, at least you have&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theloop.ca/how-to-hold-your-own-in-any-conversation/\">built up the confidence</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;have a list of&nbsp;great accomplishments for your résumé.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:360,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>When you are confident people take notice and they respond with new offers and exciting opportunities because they believe you can handle anything.&nbsp;Simple preparation and deep breaths can help you succeed in getting a raise. So, take Kelly’s advice and take control of your career path.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:200,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}\"></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Thunderbird School of Global Management Alumna Dana Manciagli '84 is the author of \"Cut the crap, Get a job\".
