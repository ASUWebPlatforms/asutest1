My father never left me alone, never differentiated between me and my brothers and he supported me even when my brothers were against my decision to run a business and travel to different countries for business.&nbsp; It has always been said that behind a successful man there is a woman’s hand, but behind my success in business is the hand of my father and his support and love.”</p>\r\n<p><span>Patricia, Peru, DreamBuilder graduate</span></p>\r\n<p>\"My parents play an important role in my life.&nbsp; My father has always motivated me to do my best, to be transparent.&nbsp; Thanks to his advice, I managed to build my business and raise my little daughter. When I'm in my struggles, when I have problems or difficult times, I often remember his wonderful teachings.&nbsp; It is a blessing to continue to count on his presence. And now his granddaughter also follows the same path...

He is a business owner and from my childhood he encouraged me to focus in his business and learn the skills of business. My father is my rights hand in each step of my life. He supported me in education, business and saved me from domestic and cultural issues. He always pushed me to become independent and have a personality (of my own); although he has a fame name in business in Afghanistan, he always feels pride to hear that he is the father of Roya, business owner of Herat.</p>\r\n<p>My father shared the knowledge of his business with me to support me and to make my business successful.

He has been always beside me and supported me in the tough situations of my life; I found him a source of my strength and power in my life. Although my father has a very strong and respected reputation, he has urged me to create my own personality and reputation for helping others.&nbsp; Now I work hard to make a personality for myself as a woman who is able to rescue people because of my reputation for helping others.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When education and learning English and studying school lessons during the Taliban regime was impossible and was known as a crime by the Taliban government for women and girls, he made it possible for me. First he found an English teacher for me and then every day he dropped me and picked me from course to study and learn English hidden from the society and people.&nbsp; He also paved the way for me to study my school lessons during the Taliban regime and rescued me from staying in the darkness of illiteracy.</p>\r\n<p>He has not been only a dad for me, he has always been like a friend and an angel who helped me to achieve my life goals and wishes. My father gave me the greatest gift anyone could give another person, he believed in me and always he encouraged me that you can achieve whatever you want and that was the greatest energy and motivation for me. So today whatever I am it’s the result of his trust and his believe on me and partially my hard work with the support of my parents.\"</p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Happy Belated Father’s Day to all of you Dads out there.&nbsp; You are the secret weapon in women’s empowerment.&nbsp; We may not talk about you all the time, but your daughters know how much you changed our world.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>"
