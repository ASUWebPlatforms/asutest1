China and the U.S. have been engaged in a trade war through increasing tariffs since&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/knowledge-network/trade-wars\">this time in 2018</a>. Business leaders in the U.S. and China as well as Europe, Japan and much of the developing world are standing on the sidelines hoping that the two world leaders are able to restart trade negotiations.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3015702/chinas-confirms-president-xi-jinpings-three-day-trip-japan\">Xi will travel to Japan</a>&nbsp;on Thursday and is expected to meet Trump on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka, a gathering of leading and emerging economies, which takes place on Friday and Saturday.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><i>“China-U.S. trade war:&nbsp;</i><i>So far, leaders from both countries have believed their economic health is robust enough to absorb negative effects and increasing political frictions.”–&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ctt.ec/a1Pa6\">Click to tweet</a></i><i><br></i></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>On Saturday,&nbsp;<i>People’s Daily</i>, the mouthpiece of China’s Communist Party said in a commentary that the trade war between China and the US could be resolved only through “equal conversation”.</p>\r\n<p>Writing for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/opinion/article/3015605/china-thinks-it-can-weather-trumps-trade-storm-it-can-not-long\">South China Morning Post</a>&nbsp;this week, Tom Holland advised global business leaders not to hold their breath for a deal this week. Robust economies in each country may allow them to ride out worsening trade tensions and support growth in the near term.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Yet, when the two men met in December 2018, also at a G20 summit, President Trump decided two delay imposing additional tariffs on China for 90 days in order for trade discussions to continue.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>25% List 3 Tariffs about to Dock</h3>\r\n<p>In the meantime, the&nbsp;25 percent tariffs on Chinese goods that the Trump administration announced in May are about to kick in in a larger way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><i>“A&nbsp;</i><i>four- to six-week buffer, which excluded tariffs on goods that were already in transit, is about to come to an end.”–&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ctt.ec/g31J8\">Click to tweet</a></i><i><br></i></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>On May 10, 2019, the Office of the US Trade Representative (USTR) increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25% (from 10%).

In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/06/13/china-is-bluffing-in-the-trade-war/\">ForeignPolicy.com</a>, Babones said, “Given Beijing’s bluster, it can be easy to forget that China is still a relatively poor country with a GDP per capita less than one-sixth the U.S. level.”&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The simple fact is, Babones concluded, that China needs the United States more than the United States needs China. “In itself, that’s no reason to start a trade war.
