    value: '<div class="page"><div class="layoutArea"><div class="column"><p>Many studies have shown that having more women in senior positions is good for business and increases a company’s diversity of perspective and thought. In fact, according to a 2019 report by the<a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_700953.pdf">&nbsp;International Labour Organization (ILO)</a>, 75% of the enterprises that cited improved bottom line from achieving gender diversity,&nbsp;&nbsp;indicated a profit increase of between 5 and 20%. Furthermore, it showed that&nbsp;enterprises with a gender-inclusive culture are 9% more likely to have improved business performance.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the 2021&nbsp;<a href="http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GGGR_2021.pdf">World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Gender Gap Report,</a>&nbsp;it will now take about&nbsp;135.6 years to close the gender gap worldwide. This is a marked improvement from the 2020&nbsp;report&nbsp;which estimated it&nbsp;would take 267.6 years to close the gap. This is due to a greater&nbsp;number of&nbsp;women in the&nbsp;workforce&nbsp;and in&nbsp;more&nbsp;diverse&nbsp;industries. Research shows that when more executive positions and boards are diverse, more women are empowered to seek&nbsp;leadership positions. It also reduces gender segregation in the workplace and creates a more inclusive environment. &nbsp;</p><p>At&nbsp;Thunderbird, we are proud of our diverse group of students and&nbsp;faculty. We&nbsp;believe in the empowerment of all and hope to help people&nbsp;globally&nbsp;achieve their dreams and aspirations&nbsp;regardless of gender, race, age or orientation.

Always think global. When I started BMGA, although the plan was to start with the Nigerian market, I always knew I wanted to offer products and services that would be valuable and accessible to consumers in other countries in Africa and other parts of the world. I didn’t want to limit BMGA’s reach to just consumers in Nigeria.”</p><h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jocelynwyatt/">Jocelyn Wyatt ‘06</a>&nbsp;</h3><p>Jocelyn is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of&nbsp;<a href="http://ideo.org/">IDEO.org</a>, the nonprofit design organization that she cofounded in 2011 after leading IDEO’s social innovation practice.
