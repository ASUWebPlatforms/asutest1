What do we do&nbsp;now?</h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">As Senator John S. McCain rounded 80, it looked like he might have his mother’s DNA: she is still alive at 106. When he died on August 25 (the same day Ted Kennedy died), I realized he was a mortal like the rest of us. But that didn’t quite capture his magic. So I turned to Hamlet for some wisdom: “He was a man. Take him for all in all. I shall not look upon his like again.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In 2016, I invited the Senator to come to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.asu.edu/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://www.asu.edu/\">Arizona State University</a>&nbsp;to be the subject of my&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.iconicvoices.tv/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"http://www.IconicVoices.tv\">YouTube interview series</a>&nbsp;in front of a student audience. It was during the middle of his reelection campaign, and he wasn't feeling the love:&nbsp;<em>“it’s going to be a tough one, Jeff, right down to the wire,”&nbsp;</em>which, of course, he won by 6%.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><span>McCain was an enigma. In many ways, he lived up to his sobriquet of a maverick whose second favorite thing was dividing the two political parties. But his favorite was to unite the country. That’s the message he brought to my twenty-something students. They heard a globe-trotting review that began with an airport story, classic McCain: “T</span><em>otal stranger walks up to me at Sky Harbor (Phoenix airport) and asks, “‘Anyone ever tell you that you look like that guy McCain?’” I said, “Yeah, I hear that a lot.” The guy says, “‘Don’t it make you mad as heck</em><span>?’”</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">McCain survived more than insults. He outlived plane crashes, POW prison&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;torture, and over three decades of Washington D.C. Throughout his storied career, from the time he jumped into a Navy cockpit in 1958 to his becoming a senator in 1986, the most palpable part of his legacy was that America was his life force, and nobody loved her more.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">My Story</h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--startsWithSingleQuote graf-after--h3\">‘Six degrees of separation’ was a phrase that could have been invented to describe McCain’s network, which ultimately included me. I met the Senator through a man McCain adored,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://president.asu.edu/about/michaelcrow\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://president.asu.edu/about/michaelcrow\">Michael Crow</a>, ASU president and America’s profoundest education philosopher, and a protégé, former NATO Ambassador,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mccaininstitute.org/staff/kurt-volker/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://www.mccaininstitute.org/staff/kurt-volker/\">Kurt Volker</a>, who runs the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mccaininstitute.org/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://www.mccaininstitute.org/\">McCain Institute</a>. My induction ceremony was listen to jokes, laugh, and if you like bird watching, better. Then you realized, he actually did live in a place called Cornville.</p>\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"0*oW5aHUfXpeufnU8f\" data-width=\"1600\" data-height=\"1600\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"0*oW5aHUfXpeufnU8f\" data-scroll=\"native\">\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*oW5aHUfXpeufnU8f\" class=\"progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image\" data-src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*oW5aHUfXpeufnU8f\">\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">John McCain telling stories during our interview (photo: Arizona State University)</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">If you hung around McCain you caught on to his bag of one-liners. Some were ice breakers and others conveyed affection. For instance, he would introduce Senator Sheldon Whitehouse as “<em>my Communist friend</em>” or mimicked Senator Heitkamp’s Norwegian lilt, “<em>heard you had anudder nice vinter in North Dakota der Heidi, ja.”</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">And if he hadn’t seen you in a while, his favorite was,&nbsp;<em>“where’ve you been? Betty Ford Clinic?”</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">McCain’s ironic view of humanity also came out during moments of emotional intensity. When one student asked about the worst thing he experienced in Vietnam, he said, “<em>My great piloting, which enabled me to intercept a surface-to-air missile with my wing</em>.”</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Fighter</h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">He loved young people. He even got along with their hero, the Senator from Vermont: “<em>Bernie and I co-authored a bill for veterans’ medical care choice. This was before he started combing his hair</em>.” He also recognized the intelligent cynicism of the next generation: “<em>If anyone here thinks a 14% congressional approval rating is good, I don’t want you driving an automobile, as you are a danger to yourself</em>.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">McCain had no illusions about the world we live in. Humans are capable of shocking, horrible things. He was Lincolnesque in this way, his enemies hated him dearly because his sheer good nature and candor inspired victories over the bad guys. The result was a lifelong Quixotic battle in which he stockpiled American values and carpet bombed opponents with humor.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Rancher</h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">Every spring, McCain would host the annual Sedona Forum at his McCain Ranch, a typical McCain hoedown where Davos mingles with&nbsp;<em>High Noon</em>. The guest list would make Queen Elizabeth jealous.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">It’s called the McCain Ranch for a reason. The food is ranch cooking and the music is cowboy. But not according to McCain’s youthful colleague, Senator Jeff Flake, who informed us, “<em>I grew up on a real ranch, and the most ranch-like thing you’re going to find at the McCain Ranch is ranch dressing</em>.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Flake was right. The McCain Ranch didn’t have cattle or sheep. But ranchers mend fences and fix things that are broken, so McCain&nbsp;<em>was</em>&nbsp;a rancher.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Fixer</h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">There were so many things McCain wanted to fix, and he spent 60 years working on a punch list. It included North Korea’s Kim, “<em>the rotund ruler,</em>” and women getting raped by human traffickers in Moldova, “<em>the evilest thing you can imagine</em>.” McCain wanted to help the Kurds’ quest for an independent nation, “<em>the largest ethnic community in the world without a country</em>.” His passions ranged from terminating ISIS and helping refugees, to putting Putin and Syria in their place. If you could help him take care of our Veterans or educate Arizonans, he was your best friend.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In the same spirit, he stood up to bullies, which of course, is an old rancher term. He came down hard on China’s Xi for imprisoning opponents to remove political obstacles. But he also criticized Obama for pulling out of Iraq prematurely because the polls said so, which opened the door for ISIS.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">McCain said the hell with the polls, and then again, he would add, “<em>that’s why I’m not the president</em>.”</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">Joker</h3>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--h3\">He thought Trump was deeply flawed. If anyone had a right to blast Trump, it was McCain, but he had an aviator cool. His comments were measured and he left the door open. That Trump didn’t take the opportunity is one of the saddest moments of the 45th president’s choppy tenure. Trump could have learned a lot from McCain, including a few jokes.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Winston Churchill said history would be kind because he intended to write it. McCain had the same philosophy. He published six history books, and the last one just came out in May. It is titled<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Restless-Wave-Causes-Fights-Appreciations-ebook/dp/B075RLXBKZ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1535319768&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+restless+wave\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" target=\"_blank\" data-href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Restless-Wave-Causes-Fights-Appreciations-ebook/dp/B075RLXBKZ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1535319768&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+restless+wave\">&nbsp;The Restless Wave: Good Times, Just Causes, Great Fights, and Other Appreciations.</a>&nbsp;The book is filled with reflections about power and geopolitical insights. It will be a difficult read for sentimental reasons, but there will be a lot of laughs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\"><strong><i>The views expressed in this article do not necessarily reflect those of Thunderbird School of Global Management or Arizona State University as a whole.</i></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Author’s Bio</strong></p>\r\n<p>Jeff Cunningham is an advocate for enlightened global leadership, which he calls the most valuable natural resource in the world.</p>\r\n<p>He is a Professor at ASU’s Thunderbird School of Global Management and was the former publisher of Forbes Magazine, startup founder, digital content CEO, and ran an internet venture capital fund.</p>\r\n<p>He travels the globe in search of iconic leaders.
