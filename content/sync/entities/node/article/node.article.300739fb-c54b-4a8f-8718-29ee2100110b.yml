Sully de Luque, a research fellow at the Garvin Center for Culture and Languages, covered a variety of topics that encouraged the women to share experiences.</p>\r\n<p>“These are women who have great potential to be able to learn the curriculum being taught here and take it back to their home country and make a significant economic impact on their businesses,” said Wynona Heim, program manager for Thunderbird for Good, the school’s philanthropic arm that includes Project Artemis. “A great lesson for these women is that they are not alone; that there is a network of entrepreneurs all over the world, facing many of the same problems. They can draw from this network.</p>\r\n<p>“They will come to understand in their experience at Thunderbird that they are businesswomen who have personal power, and that they can make a real difference with that power.”</p>\r\n<p>The 2011 Project Artemis program is modeled on Thunderbird’s successful&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thunderbird.edu/about_thunderbird/thunderbird_good/afghanistan/index.htm\">Project Artemis Afghanistan</a>, which launched in 2005 and has trained more than 60 women entrepreneurs from that country. The Pakistani women participating in this year’s program have a variety of educational backgrounds, and the majority have received college degrees in other subjects and only gained a business foundation through seminars and other trainings.</p>\r\n<p>One of the participants is Maria Umar, a 31-year-old entrepreneur who started a business in Peshawar, the capital of the northern province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. Her company, which she launched less than two years ago, markets virtual services, such as content writing, article and blog posts, transcribing, travel reservations and more.</p>\r\n<p>“I can’t wait to get back home and do this,” she said after a group discussion about best practices relating to management communication with employees. “I have learned so much already from each of these ladies.</p>\r\n<p>“The very good part of this program is that there are just nine of us and the curriculum is designed especially for us,” said Umar, who manages three on-site employees and another 10 virtually from her Peshawar office. “The professors have taken great pains to understand us, our culture and our needs. I am hearing them say some things that are so pertinent to my business, my work and my life.”</p>\r\n<p>Umar said today’s “Aha!” moment was when Sully de Luque discussed management and motivation, using an analogy of holding sand too tightly in one’s hand.</p>\r\n<p>“When Professor Mary talked about how you manage a team and how you motivate your employees, she said you have to be flexible and you must be able to maneuver so you don’t lose the sand,” Umar said. “You lose the sand, or your business, if you hold too tightly. Sometimes, too, you need different sand.”</p>\r\n<p>The morning session at Thunderbird was followed by a trip to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.mysisterscloset.com/\">My Sister’s Closet</a>&nbsp;in north Scottsdale, Arizona, where participants were able to observe business practices firsthand and had the opportunity to discuss the challenges unique to running a clothing and accessories consignment store.</p>"
