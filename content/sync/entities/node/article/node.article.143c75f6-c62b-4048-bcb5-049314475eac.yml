    value: "<p>Born in Kabul, Afghanistan, Fatima Hakimzada currently works as Deputy Director of Demo Construction Company in which she is a primary shareholder, and is in her third year of law school.&nbsp; As with so many businesswomen in Afghanistan today, she harbors dreams that take muscle to realize:&nbsp;schools for the country’s children, some too poor to do anything except beg for bread on the streets, destined for brief lives bereft of the most basic needs.&nbsp; &nbsp;A natural leader in her community, Fatima has has just returned from participating in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://vitalvoices.org/program-news/vital-voices-asia\" title=\"Vital Voices Asia 2010\">Vital Voices regional conference&nbsp;</a>in Asia, held September 14<span>th</span>-16<span>th</span>&nbsp;in New Delhi, India.</p>\r\n<p>Now, as a graduate of the&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.10000women.org/\">10,000 Women&nbsp;</a></em>Program in Afghanistan, run through a partnership between the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.auaf.edu.af/\">American University of Afghanistan&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thunderbird.edu/\">Thunderbird School of Global Management&nbsp;</a>in Glendale, Arizona, USA<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;Hakimzada’s dreams are beginning to metamorphose into a viable business plan.&nbsp; The ragged, dirt-caked children on the city’s streets may soon be scrubbed clean, pencils in hand, each sitting tall and alert at their desks.</p>\r\n<p>Hakimzada envisions schools targeting male and female students five to eighteen years old who would undergo entry examinations to uncover strengths and weaknesses, with low income students admitted tuition free.&nbsp; She expects to attract funding from both private and public national and international organizations, and if need be her own resources.&nbsp; Having learned the steps essential in launching her vision in the&nbsp;<em>10,000 Women&nbsp;</em>program sponsored by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www2.goldmansachs.com/\">Goldman Sachs</a>, Hakimzada’s goal for 2011 is to raise the capital the project will require.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Hakimzada was fortunate to be born into an educated family that supported and encouraged her while instilling a sense of self-sufficiency unknown to most Afghan women. &nbsp;Her family was her inspiration, but it was her own hard work and single-minded commitment that led her to the&nbsp;<em>10,000 Women</em>&nbsp;Program<strong>&nbsp;</strong>where she learned shoulder to shoulder with other dreamers like herself, how to prepare for gritty battles ahead in bringing life to private ambitions.&nbsp; She is now engrossed in research, making vital connections within the business world, and drafting a business plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Hakimzada expects success because there is a gaping need for education in Afghanistan, and given her own experience, she is convinced that education is the country’s foundation for a free and prosperous future.&nbsp; A further boost to her management skills and knowledge will come from participating in the October, 2010 class of Project Artemis in Arizona, run through Thunderbird’s Office of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thunderbird.edu/about_thunderbird/thunderbird_good/index.htm\">Thunderbird for Good</a>, Project Artemis is a unique business skills training program which builds the entrepreneurial skills of promising Afghan businesswomen.</p>"
