Psyche is a planned orbiter mission that will explore the origin of planetary cores by studying the metallic asteroid 16 Psyche. “This mission will be the first time humans will ever be able to see a planetary core,” said&nbsp;Prof. Elkins-Tanton, who proposed the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://womeninastronomy.blogspot.com/2015/11/the-discovery-program-series-psyche-pi.html\">mission for NASA’s Discovery Program</a>. Prof. Elkins-Tanton’s team, which has no prior experience performing such a mission impressively beat out many others in a long pitch process.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>“The call of the wild places, of exploration, is also deep in our human bones,” the professor wrote in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2019/01/women-in-space-leadership-nasa-psyche-mission.html\">recent Slate article</a>&nbsp;about how the future of space exploration is female.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><i>“ASU Prof. Lindy Elkins-Tanton’s message about the business of space travel is in keeping with Thunderbird’s new strategy to prepare leaders for the 4th Industrial Revolution.”–&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ctt.ec/_Pr98\">Click to tweet</a></i><a href=\"https://ctt.ec/_Pr98\"><i>&nbsp;</i></a><i></i></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h3>Understanding Psyche to Understand Ourselves</h3>\r\n<p>Psyche will be the first mission to a world made of metal instead of rock or ice, which previous expeditions have focused on. Initial research by Prof. Elkins-Tanton and her team suggest that the Psyche asteroid offers a unique window into the history of collisions and accretion (or&nbsp;accumulation of particles into a massive object)&nbsp;to which scientists credit the formation of the planetary system.</p>\r\n<p>Since humanity cannot see or measure the Earth’s core directly, Prof. Elkins-Tanton said, Psyche is the only known place in our solar system where we can directly examine what is presumed to be the metallic core of an early planet.</p>\r\n<h3>The Business of Exploration</h3>\r\n<p>The $760 million Psyche mission is expected to begin in the summer of 2022 and return to Earth in 2027.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>An&nbsp;<a href=\"https://psyche.asu.edu/mission/the-team/\">impressive team of scientists and researchers</a>&nbsp;has been assembled to build the spacecraft needed to make this mission possible. Imagine if you will, a team of nearly 40 people representing 15 distinct institutions, all highly regarded experts in their fields.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And they are led by an expert in planetary formation an evolution who is also a little like project CEO. Prof. Elkins-Tanton’s time as principal investigator is increasingly taken up by the day-to-day responsibilities that go with managing such a diverse team. Part of the Psyche team leader’s role is to develop the budget and make sure that costs continue to align with it even as market conditions continue to fluctuate.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><i>“Some key management skills you need to lead a successful space exploration mission include team management, budget forecasting and management, negotiations, and pitching.” ~ Prof. Lindy Elkins-Tanton –&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ctt.ec/aB5y4\">Click to tweet</a></i></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Prof. Elkins-Tanton credits her success so far as the Psyche’s PI to the time she has spent working with the corporate world, acquiring and honing fundamental management skills, a unique perspective that most career academics like her seldom have the opportunity to acquire.</p>\r\n<h3>The Exploration of Business&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p>“Some key management skills you need to lead a successful space exploration mission,” according to Prof. Elkins-Tanton, “include team management, budget forecasting and management, negotiations, and proposal writing and pitching.”</p>\r\n<p>While none of these skills are usually taught in scientific doctoral or research programs, they are certainly par for the course in business or management degree programs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thunderbird’s new transdisciplinary curriculum, which offers 16 different concentrations in addition to the core management courses that are the hallmark of the Thunderbird Degree are designed to help students get ready for the new career opportunities that the 4thIndustrial Revolution provides.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So far, none of those concentrations covers space exploration, but there is definitely a lot of overlap, a lot that space scientists and global business leaders can learn from each other.</p>\r\n<p><i>The April 10 workshop was the first in a new series of workshops that will take place twice a year. For alumni, opportunities to keep up with trends in business and innovation are provided through several professional development initiatives, including monthly webinars covering various subjects related to the 4th Industrial Revolution.</i></p>\r\n<p><i><!--break--><strong>Author's bio</strong></i></p>\r\n<p><i>This article is written by Olivia Mulerwa, a December ‘18 graduate of Thunderbird who currently works as a project manager in the Office of Alumni Engagement.

    summary: "In today’s business world, innovation is considered the key to longevity. The idea of venturing into the unknown to explore new frontiers – whether that means seeking out new markets or new product lines, is at the heart of most successful business strategies. The unprecedented success of companies like Amazon, Airbnb, and Netflix, often at the expense of their more traditional industry counterparts has changed business forever. \r\n\r\nWhile there has been much buzz around the idea of innovation lately, perhaps we can all agree that nothing is more innovative than space exploration.  The idea of going beyond the known world to explore new frontiers outside of the earth’s axis, is indeed at the vanguard of the vanguard."
