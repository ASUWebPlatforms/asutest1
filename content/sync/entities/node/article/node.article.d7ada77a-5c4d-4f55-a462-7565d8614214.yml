    value: "<p><strong>DreamBuilder Inspires Ecuador Global Consulting Lab Team!</strong></p>\r\n<p>September 10, 2018</p>\r\n<p>By Olivia Mulerwa</p>\r\n<p>Summer 2018 Global Consulting Lab (GCL)<br>Ecuador, Heifer</p>\r\n<p>How do you transform an entire business education into a program that can improve the lives of rural entrepreneurs in Ecuador? That was the question on the minds of five enthusiastic Thunderbird students, forming Heifer Ecuador’s <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/consulting-labs\">Global Consulting Lab</a> team. This question became ever more daunting as we made our way across the country from Quito, Ecuador’s capital, visiting businesses that were not only diverse in product offering, but level of growth as well. Enter, DreamBuilder. Fortunately, for my team, I had already been a member of <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/global-impact/thunderbird-for-good-programs\">Thunderbird for Good’s</a> <a href=\"https://dreambuilder.org/\">DreamBuilder</a> program for the better part of the year and I was already thinking of how DreamBuilder could be applied in this project.</p>\r\n<p>[[{\"fid\":\"65089\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":false,\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"5\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":false,\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false}},\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"5\"}}]]</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"65084\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":false,\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":false,\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false}},\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">L-R: Dray, Bonnie, Marissa, Alex, Olivia</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Before we got started, we spent the first week traveling all over the country meeting the rural entrepreneurs who would be the beneficiaries of the training module. It was both interesting and impactful for us to see first-hand how Heifer is making a difference in the lives of rural farming communities. We saw everything from a well-established dairy business, (that had been in operation for over 20 years), to a very motivated group of Alpaca farmers deep in the mountains who dreamed of growing their business to rival the better-known Peruvian Alpaca Industry. While many consulting projects are often marathons, this one was definitely a sprint.</p>\r\n<p>As it turned out, there were many parallels to be drawn between Heifer’s rural businesses and DreamBuilder’s network of businesses. Like DreamBuilder, Heifer was working with entrepreneurs who had no previous business training and many of the businesses were women-owned and women-led. In addition, many of the business owners’ we met had varying levels of literacy and as a result, this led us to develop a curriculum that could meet the needs of the different groups.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"65085\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Sample of Heifer rural businesses\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"2\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"Sample of Heifer rural businesses\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false}},\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"Sample of Heifer rural businesses\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"2\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">Sample of Heifer rural businesses</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When putting together the final curriculum, we thought of all the materials that would be helpful to Heifer’s trainers. <a href=\"https://dreambuilder.org/\">DreamBuilder</a> came in handy because it has an easy to use platform focusing on providing real life examples that the learners can easily relate to. Having spent a whole week visiting the rural businesses that would use our training curriculum, we had a wealth of examples to draw from for our module.</p>\r\n<p>We also had the complex task of finding commonalities among the different businesses, which were at different levels of growth.&nbsp; Despite these many differences among the businesses, we were able to adapt best business practices from DreamBuilder to create a contextually responsive training curriculum that we hope will stand the test of time.</p>\r\n<p>DreamBuilder inspired our team to organize the training curriculum into distinct focus areas, which are: Finance, Marketing and Management; focus areas that can be taught together or separately, depending on the particular business need. In each focus area, we identified some key points of need across the businesses we visited which were then translated into learning objectives. We eventually developed lesson plans around those objectives.</p>\r\n<p>To address the different levels of growth among the businesses, our final curriculum was developed in three levels. Level 1 was designed for the least developed businesses and level 3 designed for the most advanced businesses. The goal is that all of Heifer’s partner businesses will be able to move across the 3 levels. Each level, designed to teach an important business skill, ensures that the entrepreneurs benefit from all the levels.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks to DreamBuilder’s inspiration, our team was able to present a detailed 236 page-training curriculum to Heifer’s business development director and other members of the organization.</p>\r\n<p>For more information on the DreamBuilder program, click <a href=\"http://www.dreambuilder.org/\">www.dreambuilder.org</a> and learn how they support entrepreneurs who want to start or grow their own business! &nbsp;And for more information on Thunderbird’s Global Consulting Laboratory and all the global applied experiences available at Thunderbird, visit <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/consulting-labs\">https://thunderbird.asu.edu/consulting-labs</a></p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"65086\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":false,\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"3\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":false,\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false}},\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"3\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">Consulting Team with Heifer team after final presentation</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><br>&nbsp;</p>"
