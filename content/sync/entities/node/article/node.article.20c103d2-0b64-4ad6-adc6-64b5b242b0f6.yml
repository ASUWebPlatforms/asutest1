    value: "<h3 class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3 graf--subtitle\">Sometimes the most difficult challenges are our greatest inspiration.</h3>\r\n<blockquote>“Be yourself. Everyone else is already taken.” — Oscar&nbsp;Wilde</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><em>At @GeneralElectric headquarters, I met with Jeff Immelt to get his take on how to inspire your team by facing challenges head on at the exact time your instinct says shut up. He gave me five simple paradigms for authenticity in leadership that I share below. If you are interested in watching the full interview:</em></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>[[{\"fid\":\"10225\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\"},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"1\":{\"format\":\"default\"}},\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"1\"}}]]</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure\">1. Do you talk openly about the the company’s headwinds?</h3>\r\n<blockquote>“I’ve done this for 14 years. For anyone who thinks it’s easy, these are hard jobs. But you also have this sense that no matter what happens we can get&nbsp;better.”</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Yes, your people need to know what the leader is going through.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">This is not the “suffering in silence era.” Communicate during a crisis, just when people feel like hiding, and they’ll be more open about accepting difficult solutions.</p>\r\n<blockquote>Relate on a deeply personal level and your team will repay you by bringing their best thinking.</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Immelt joined GE four days before 9/11 and the impact on the company was devastating, as it was for everyone. He learned that speaking openly about the challenges the company now faced inspired the team to dwell on the future and not the past.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">2. Are you putting off unpopular decisions that might enable the company to&nbsp;pivot?</h3>\r\n<blockquote>“I had this feeling we were still constructed for an American-centric economy and I realized we had to get more&nbsp;global.”</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Every company has great customers; great companies have great markets.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">That old warning, ‘don’t sell ice cream to Eskimos’, may sound logical but is actually a delusion. Markets are no longer static. (In fact, the Inuit have actually acquired a great love for ice cream, called&nbsp;<em>akutok</em>). Pivots are the future and the only variable is when you do it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Today, Immelt says, business has no shelf life, and what was right ten years ago may now be obsolete. You are always planning for the next disruption, and that means looking at new markets all the time.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When Immelt took over GE his product lines were 80% consumed in the United States. Today that’s down to 20%. Changing market focus can be the most challenging of transformations, which is why he faced it head on by making it the cornerstone of GE’s strategy.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">3. Do you let fierce competitors intimidate — or inspire the&nbsp;team?</h3>\r\n<blockquote>“We don’t want to be Microsoft or Google, but we’re inspired to be better because of&nbsp;them.”</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Speed is stealth — just as with a fighter jet — it allows companies to move silently into a new sector, like Google’s self driving cars and Amazon’s Cloud. It also means that one day you will look up to find you are facing these companies in what you believed was ‘your’ market.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Immelt saw a choice: lose market share to more agile competitors or be inspired by them. Your employees already know who the ‘hot’ company is and may even hope to work there. You can’t afford to lose that kind of talent by ignoring what gets their juices flowing. These are crucial facts of business life in a global innovative era.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">The proper response is to let them know you will move mountains to be as good or better than brand X that’s setting the world on fire. Immelt’s optimism in the face of competition is one of his secret weapons because he makes the task a strategic challenge that his team can execute, not a futile effort to prove a point.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As an aside, I also found&nbsp;Immelt never relies on the word ‘profit’ to motivate his people, which is so often part of a typical CEO’s jargon. Immelt knows profit is the result of inspired leadership, not the inspiration.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">4. Have you built a culture in which performance drives diversity?</h3>\r\n<blockquote>“If you can bring it, if you’ve got merit, if you’re winning, you’re going to get promoted.</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Not&nbsp;<em>everyone</em>&nbsp;will make it to CEO, but everyone needs to know that&nbsp;<em>anyone</em>&nbsp;can make it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Today’s genius isn’t likely to come from the same gene pool as tomorrow’s. When the organization knows you operate from a foundation of total fairness, inclusiveness, and openness, they know this is a place they can grow, learn, and thrive. Titles are secondary.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Immelt said that when you are CEO of GE it means you are running a meritocracy. In all his messaging, Immelt strives to send the signal that talent, teamwork, and performance are the only demographics that interest him.</p>\r\n<h3 class=\"graf graf--h3 graf-after--p\">5. Can you talk about bad times in a way that motivates others to overcome challenges?</h3>\r\n<blockquote>“There’s no doubt in my mind, when I talk to other leaders, you haven’t led until you’ve been through a ‘flying close to the sun’ tail&nbsp;risk.</blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote\">Failure is incompatible with authentic leadership.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">By leading through a downturn you assure you can survive what Immelt calls ‘tail risk’. That gives you the confidence to move forward and make bold decisions about the future.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">A secondary benefit is that your people act and think like a team because they have shared this defining experience.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Immelt talked about 9/11 and the financial crisis, as both took direct aim at a number of GE businesses such as transportation, finance, and energy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As he reengineered the company for a global and digital transformation, he learned that with totally authentic leadership, tough times vanish but the talent stays the course.</p>\r\n<p>Author’s Bio<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></p>\r\n<p>Jeff Cunningham is an advocate for enlightened global leadership, which he calls the most valuable natural resource in the world.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></p>\r\n<p>He is a Professor at ASU’s Thunderbird School of Global Management and was the former publisher of Forbes Magazine, startup founder, digital content CEO, and ran an internet venture capital fund.<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"></span></p>\r\n<p>He travels the globe in search of iconic leaders.
