They were newlyweds, and my dad’s “Nonno” had asked them to accompany him on one of his annual trips to his hometown&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fodors.com/world/europe/italy/the-italian-riviera/places/chiavari\">Chiavari</a>, a small town by the Cinque Terre in the Liguria region. My dad was extremely close to his Nonno, having lived with him for a significant amount of time in his 20s, and had always looked forward to a day when he could experience Italy with his grandfather.</p>\r\n<p><span>So about 25 years ago, my parents began the journey, sightseeing through Italy with their own personal tour guide in the form of my great-grandfather. My dad still talks about this trip every chance he can get, and being a writer himself, has written about it many times (his most recent rendition of the story can be found&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.bristolglobal.com/cup-of-joe/cup-of-joe-relationally-radical/\"><span>here</span></a><span>, if interested). They started in Rome and eventually made their way to the quaint and inviting town of Chiavari. After excitedly showing them around his hometown on their first evening in the city, Nonno said goodnight and promised to meet my parents in the hotel lobby at 9 a.m. the next day. However, the next morning Nonno never came downstairs.</span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://dastornews.com/2017/11/viaggio-nel-tempo-in-italia-time-traveling-in-italy/\">Read more...</a></p>"
