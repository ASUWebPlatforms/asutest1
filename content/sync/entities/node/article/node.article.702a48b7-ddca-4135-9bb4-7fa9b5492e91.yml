While class work can prepare you for real-world work experiences and provide tools that will help you do your job, classroom-only education falls short of ideal. Experiential, or real-world, learning helps fill the gap.</p>\r\n<p>Some debate the relative value of <a href=\"/node/3012\">classroom education vs. experiential learning</a>. But the truth is there is no debate. The two are not mutually exclusive. Education gained inside a classroom will always be beneficial. But using what was learned in the classroom and applying it to real-world experiences is the most robust – and valuable – education.</p>\r\n<h3>Classroom learning <i>and</i> experiential learning</h3>\r\n<p>A degree or certificate is certainly an asset. But when it is backed by real-world, hands-on experience, that degree or certificate will help turn your understanding into action. And that adds value for you – and your employer.</p>\r\n<p>Whether you’re taking classes to kick off a business career or to rethink and retool what you want to do in the next stage of your career, employers are looking for people with real-world experiences – people who can show up and quickly contribute.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>“The best classrooms begin your experiential learning journey and plant the seeds that grow during your career.” – <a href=\"https://ctt.ec/d26Qk\">Click to tweet</a><a href=\"#_msocom_1\" id=\"_anchor_1\" name=\"_msoanchor_1\"></a></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>A traditional classroom setting can help lead you to facts and offer you knowledge that comes from what others know. Experiential learning can help you transform those facts and turn that knowledge into true understanding.</p>\r\n<h3>Experiential learning adds rocket fuel to your business skills</h3>\r\n<p>The following is a list of 10 essential business skills you can begin developing inside the classroom. And then, through experiential learning (like our ‘<a href=\"/node/3012\">grown-up study abroad programs</a>’), you enhance that basic understanding by putting your new skills into action. (At Thunderbird, experiential learning takes place in the classroom too: students are introduced to experiential learning in the classroom itself with real-life simulations, role-playing, etc.) &nbsp;</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>“Employers are looking for graduates with real-world experiences, people who can show up and quickly contribute.” – <a href=\"https://ctt.ec/f9Meu\">Click to tweet&nbsp;</a></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<h3>10 Essential Skills for Business – And How to Build Them</h3>\r\n<table style=\"width: 100%;\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr><th><strong> The skill </strong></th><th><strong> Why it matters in business </strong></th><th><strong> How you learn it in the classroom </strong></th><th><strong> How you build it through experiential learning </strong></th></tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><strong>1.
