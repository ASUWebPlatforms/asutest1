    value: "<p>Marshall Parke, ’77, and Veronique Parke, founders of the Thunderbird SHARE Fellowship, renewed their commitment to the program with a contribution of $250,000.&nbsp; In 2007, Mr. Parke began formulating a plan to provide scholarships for students from developing countries who might otherwise not have the resources to attend Thunderbird. Since awarding its first scholarships in 2008, SHARE has funded scholarships for 46 students from 28 countries from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe. The SHARE Fellowship is supported entirely by alumni efforts; alumni serve on the selection committee, provide financial resources, mentor SHARE fellows, and offer guidance for internships and employment.</p>\r\n<p>The Parkes’ donation supports program administration, so donations directly support student scholarships and experiences. Several additional alumni are joining Parke with philanthropic support to ensure the program’s success. Robert Zorich, ’74 recently supported the Thunderbird SHARE Fellowship with a gift of $150,000 and pledged an additional $100,000 if the Thunderbird community meets his challenge of raising $1 million in funding for the program. Eric Bing ’94 and David Young ‘91 both committed $50,000 toward the program as well. Because of the generosity of the Parkes, Mr. Zorich, and other supporters, the Thunderbird SHARE Fellowship plans to award six full scholarships this upcoming academic year to students from countries such as South Sudan and Vietnam.</p>\r\n<p>Click <a href=\"https://thunderbird.asu.edu/about/giving/share-fellowship\">here</a> to learn more about the SHARE Fellowship. If you are interested in helping Thunderbird meet Mr. Zorich’s challenge and supporting the program, contact <a href=\"mailto:Patrick.F.McDermott@thunderbird.asu.edu\">Patrick McDermott</a>, Chief Engagement Officer.</p>"
