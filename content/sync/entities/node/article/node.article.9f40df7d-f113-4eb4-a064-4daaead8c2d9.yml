    value: "<h2 class=\"graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3 graf--subtitle\">Donald Trump’s regulatory guru took on the labor unions who destroy American competitiveness while lining their&nbsp;pockets.</h2>\r\n<div class=\"section-content\">\r\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">We need a national rethink of the old labor management divide: President-elect&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/10/donald-trump-got-reagan-like-support-from-union-households/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/11/10/donald-trump-got-reagan-like-support-from-union-households/\">Donald Trump won 43% of voting union&nbsp;</a>households.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">To get some perspective on this issue, I called up former SEC Commissioner Paul S. Atkins, appointed by President George W. Bush in 2002, and a senior advisor to President-elect Donald Trump, who is no stranger to the complex world of labor and anti-business activist influence.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Atkins shared the following thoughts on the ways politics, labor unions, and anti-business activist organizations can coerce business while appearing pro shareholder (this interview also appeared in Directorship Magazine).</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"section-divider\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"section-content\">\r\n<div class=\"section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn\">\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf--leading\">Political donation disclosure on the surface sounds like a good thing.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In the wake of the Citizens United decision, shareholder activists, including unions, state pension funds and “socially responsible investors,” have increasingly turned to shareholder proposals to burden American businesses exercising First Amendment rights. While disclosure of these non-material expenditures might seem harmless, activists have not been shy about their true intention, which is to inhibit free speech.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For example, George Soros funded&nbsp;<a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" data-href=\"http://mediamatters.org/\">Media Matters</a>, which bills itself as a “progressive research and information center,” says its goal is “to make the case that political spending is not within the fiduciary interest of publicly traded corporations and therefore should be limited.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"><em>(Editor’s note: Media Matters website does not disclose donors, advisors, officers or its work on behalf of labor unions — referring to them as ‘activists’.)</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Its tactic is to aggressively attack public companies for supporting policies with which it disagrees by providing information to “progressive partners” such as the AFL-CIO, SEIU, AFSCME and MoveOn.org, which then use that information out of context to tarnish companies’ reputations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For instance, assume that a particular company contributes to a pro-business organization promoting corporate tax reform and that organization backs a candidate for elected office. Media Matters’ action network will portray that company’s financial support of the organization as an endorsement of the candidate and everything he or she has said or done — which is not the case.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Far from protecting the company, the disclosure of its political activities will subject it to increased harassment from those with an opposing view.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Who are the targets of these “progressive partners”?</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Media Matters’ network is aiming at any pro-business associations and the companies that support them.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Have individuals been targeted?</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Susan Bayh, an independent director who sits on the board of WellPoint, was targeted with a just-vote-no campaign. It didn’t work — she got more than 90 percent of the vote — but it was meant as a message to individual directors that could be hazardous not only to your company but also to your personal reputation.</p>\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\">\r\n<div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded\" data-image-id=\"0*RA5M1_lgSA_5T_jv.jpg\" data-width=\"900\" data-height=\"507\" data-is-featured=\"true\" data-action=\"zoom\" data-action-value=\"0*RA5M1_lgSA_5T_jv.jpg\" data-scroll=\"native\">[[{\"fid\":\"5704\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":false,\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":false},\"type\":\"media\",\"attributes\":{\"class\":\"panopoly-image-original media-element file-default\"},\"link_text\":null}]]</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--figure\">Is activist spin working?</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">When faced with pressure from activists, even large companies such as Coca-Cola and McDonald’s back down.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">One example is the pro-business American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), which was targeted by activists because of its work with state legislatures on regulatory and tax reform.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">In the wake of the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, activists seized on ALEC’s work regarding voter identification to create negative publicity for contributors, especially big retail companies who supported the organization.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Companies are always going to be susceptible to this pressure because they’re afraid of boycotts.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">What should smart companies and their boards be doing?</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">As with anything, the best approach for corporate directors and management teams is clarity of purpose and tying activities to building (including protecting) shareholder value.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Companies should reach out to their shareholders to explain why they need to be engaged in advocacy, including trade associations. It is a dangerous world — if you are not vigilant about protecting your interests, you may get eaten before you know it.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Disclosure proponents are promoting their agenda under the banner of “more information is always better.” Do you buy that logic?</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">Although the talking points of democracy — transparency, openness and disclosure — would seem to play well among shareholders, even the activists agree that disclosure isn’t really their goal.</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\">For example, Mike Dean, the director of Minnesota Common Cause, has stated, “We want to make the case that political spending is not good for business. You’re going to offend your customer base no matter who you give to.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing\">Similarly, Mayor of New York Bill de Blasio, formerly of the Campaign for Accountability in Political Spending, has suggested that disclosure is just the stick to be used to browbeat companies. He said, “What happened to Target [which was attacked for contributing to a pro-business advocacy group] was child’s play compared to the strength that all of these organizations can bring to bear against companies that decide we’re going to go against.”</p>\r\n<h4>Author’s Bio</h4>\r\n<p>Jeff Cunningham is an advocate for enlightened global leadership, which he calls the most valuable natural resource in the world.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>He is a Professor at ASU’s Thunderbird School of Global Management and was the former publisher of Forbes Magazine, startup founder, digital content CEO, and ran an internet venture capital fund.</p>\r\n<p>He travels the globe in search of iconic leaders.
