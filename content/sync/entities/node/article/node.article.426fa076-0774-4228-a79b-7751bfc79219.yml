Photo Credit: Random Stranger</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>We recently arrived in Romania to work with a small IT company in the northwest city of Cluj-Napoca: <a href=\"http://servustech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ServUsTECH</a>. The name ServUsTECH is a play on a Romanian phrase meaning “service to all”. They provide solutions in the application, web, cloud, hardware, and firmware space, leveraging the rapid adoption of IoT in Eastern Europe and beyond. We will be establishing a marketing and sales plan for entry into the US market, while also providing cultural, sales, and marketing training to the ServUsTECH team.</p>\r\n<p>Romania is home to Transylvania, Dracula and his castle (affectionately pronounced with a hard “t” by the Romanians), and a recent history of Communism. This Eastern European country shares borders with Ukraine, Moldova, Bulgaria, Serbia, Hungary, and the Black Sea. It is a place where less than 50 years ago a common mode of transportation was horse and buggy, and a bloody revolution just 30 years ago removed the people from the oppressive rule of Communism.</p>\r\n<p>Our travel to Eastern Europe came with long flights, jet lag, flight-sharing with a professional sports team, and a serendipitous run-in at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport with Thunderbird’s very own <a href=\"/node/160\">Professor Richard Ettenson</a>.</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"64615\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Romania\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Romania\"},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"3\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Romania\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Romania\"}},\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"TEM Lab in Romania\",\"title\":\"TEM Lab in Romania\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"3\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">T-birds in Romania.

If you were along for the ride, you might find us enjoying meals of tripe soup, sausages with wedge potato fries, a cabbage dish called Varză à la Cluj, or finishing an evening with gelato (every evening, of course). We could be spotted on early-morning runs, playing pick-up games of basketball with local youth at Central Park, making a fool of ourselves on the installed park exercise equipment, or playing with the resident kitten at the entrance to our apartment complex.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div class=\"caption  mceTemp draggable\">\r\n<div style=\"width: auto;\" class=\"caption-width-container\">\r\n<div class=\"caption-inner\">[[{\"fid\":\"64616\",\"view_mode\":\"default\",\"fields\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Romania\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Romania\"},\"link_text\":null,\"type\":\"media\",\"field_deltas\":{\"4\":{\"format\":\"default\",\"field_file_image_alt_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Romania\",\"field_file_image_title_text[und][0][value]\":\"TEM Lab in Romania\"}},\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"TEM Lab in Romania\",\"title\":\"TEM Lab in Romania\",\"class\":\"media-element file-default\",\"data-delta\":\"4\"}}]]\r\n<p class=\"caption-text\">It seems there are gelato shops on every corner!
